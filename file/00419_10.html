<p>absolutely no chance of your coming here (and I shall wire you tomorrow) I shall sail on the 18th. <u>If</u> you come I can stay until the 25th. I am going to Eumorphopolos (is that the right way to spell it) for the next week end (the 12th) on Saturday the 11th and am spending Monday & Tuesday of this week with Mrs. Morgan at her</p>
<p>[p. 14]</p>
<p>country place in Watford. I <u>must</u> say I grudge the time for <u>that</u> awfully then (<u>if</u> you do not come!) I am going to Cambridge for a day & a night with the Sydney Cockerells & to Oxford with Warner – & the last week end I am to spend with Lady Barlow near Manchester so that I can see the John Rylands library – (<u>also</u> if you don’t come – only) going from there to Liverpool for my boat – Thursday & Friday I am going to Chatsworth but alas! the Devonshires will not be there – however </p>
