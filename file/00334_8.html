<p>all the gossip that comes around my job & my Boss – I suggested to Mr. Jack that he insist upon Murray’s coming over here before the end of August as he is <u>absolutely</u> incoherent & useless by correspondence – He has cooled considerable toward me since his confab with Duveen, in a way a pity as I will not learn much more direct from <u>him</u> if he suspects me – no more for now of me darrling – I will write again tomorrow I still miss you continuously Isn’t it a bit queer? Ever and ever & ever <u>Your</u>  <u>Belle</u> </p>
