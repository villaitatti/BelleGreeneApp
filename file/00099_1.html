<p>Friday Nov. 4 – 10 a.m.</p>
<p>Dear dear dear –</p>
<p>I have just received your letter of the 27thby theMauretania and was <u>so</u> delighted to have it. You don’t know how I love to hear from you Fiamma mia – I rush through all the mail until I find one in your hand & then I let <u>every</u> thing– go – even</p>
<p>Wall Street until I have read it – The reason I did not send you a cable <u>immediately</u> upon my arrival in New York was that I was not left alone a <u>single</u> moment – for twenty four hours someone or several people held my hands & would not let me get away – otherwise you should have had it the moment I landed for I thought of you every minute and <u>do</u>  <u>still</u> .</p>
