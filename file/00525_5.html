<p>out to Detroit & was installed for a brief space in Booth’s house, but now has diggings of his own – I was quite <u>too</u> busy most of the time he was here – & could only manage to have him for luncheon once & see him at the Library twice – but May Lou Emmett was good to him – & took him to <u>“swell”</u> dinners & ultrasmart dances etc. etc. & he was quite bowled over –</p>
<p>Please tell Nicky that I saw her Holstein for a brief moment and will try my best to work him in at a dinner for some other furriners, Paul of Greece</p>
