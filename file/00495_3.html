<p>operation on Sunday – It sickens me – I cannot bear to see an attractive <u>young</u> person, with an assured successful future before him, snuffed out like that – the Payne Whitney’s were at Biddle’s party on Tuesday night and this afternoon I heard that Payne W. is at the hospital to be operated on for the same malady & is in a critically dangerous condition – It’s really <u>too</u> awful!</p>
<p>I think I wrote you that</p>

<p>I contemplated making an effort to better “Art in America” when I first broached the subject to Sherman, he appeared overjoyed – fell <u>all</u> over me with gratitude and was so humble that I expected to hear of <u>his</u> demise within a few days.</p>
<p>Well I worked out a few ideas and submitted the general plan to Forbes & Sachs – I paid no attention to the finances as I knew that</p>
