<p> <u>Tuesday</u> Nov. 22</p>
<p>Dearest “lamb” –</p>
<p>Yesterday I received your delightful letter of the 7 & 8 from Milan: It was <u>so</u> interesting – I love <u>all</u> your letters and never know which kind I like best – When you write me a letter devoted solely to “ <u>You</u> & <u>Me</u> ,” I think</p>
<p>[p. 2]</p>
<p>that must <u>surely</u> be the nicest and then you write me in a fascinating way of all the beautiful things you are seeing & the people you are playing with – like your letter from Milan & I think <u>that</u> surely must be the nicest sort of letter to receive – so you see you please me either way – I sent the grapefruit [you?]</p>
