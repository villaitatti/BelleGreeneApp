<p>“in-laws” for dinner – And me a sick woman! More tomorrow –</p>
<p>Monday morning –</p>
<p>You very dearest – I had your adorable boat letter this morning and find, to my everlasting joy that you feel exactly as I do and in fact, as I wrote you yesterday about our “parting” – Also I felt you were angelic to put up with that nauseating cold – I felt so disgustingly like Mrs. Strong with it – I stayed at home all day yesterday and cut off the telephone and so was absolutely undisturbed. The family for dinner last night and a more queerly assorted bunch you never saw – no one (except my kid sister Teddy) resembling any one else – Ethel and Teddy who had been working in the rain all afternoon in hilarious and uproarious spirits, absolutely <u>untouchable</u> – myself dull and grouchy and sniffling and my elder sister Louise, looking very much like a Japanese lady of exquisite quality. I am sorry you did not meet her when you were here. She has been in Florida for two months</p>
