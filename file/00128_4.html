<p>word and I love you, if possible more, with every post –</p>
<p>I am anticipating the <u>time</u> of my life arranging my photographs in books – which reminds me – what I want above & beyond textiles etc. is several photographs of your dear self – one for my dressing table – one for my bureau – one for my writing desk & one for my table beside my bed – Don’t have them <u>too</u> large as I want to frame them nicely – I want a full-face – side face – full length & seated photo. and please send [<i>quintuple underlined</i>: at once].</p>
<p>I have a lovely new monogram for myself – [<i>symbol</i>: a backwards “B” directly beside a front-facing “B”] – isn’t that thrilling – It was put in diamonds on a cigarette case a friend gave me for Christmas – but he little knew how <u>much</u> it meant – <u>Daarrling how</u> I love you – I kiss your eyelashes – Belle</p>
