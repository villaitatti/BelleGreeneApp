<p>pegging away pretty steadily at this Library, trying to whip my catalogue of the manuscripts in shape as I want to take the manuscripts over & have Sydney Cockerell go through it with me – as there are over 600 MSS. its no very easy task –</p>
<p>De Ricci has been <u>awfully</u> kind in helping me to ferret out former owners etc. & getting & giving me all sorts of useful information – I'm rather sorry I was so nasty to him in the beginning and am trying to make up for it by doing what I can to ease up his time here & give him some of our catalogues etc.</p>
