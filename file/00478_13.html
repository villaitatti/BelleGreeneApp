<p>other afternoon and talked at me as if he had known me all my life – Asked me if I had yet heard from you, how much he had enjoyed seeing you here and " <u>what</u> is the mystery book of the Hamilton paintings?" etc. etc – I moved away as soon as I could – but have not the <u>remotest</u> idea as to his identity – I have a bad trick of never remembering people unless I like or dislike them definitely.</p>
