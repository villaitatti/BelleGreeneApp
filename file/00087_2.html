<p>still hope to get it here in time to dispose of it to advantage. As to your coming here – I fear it will be too late by the time you get this, but I should be perfectly <u>delighted</u> to see you. I tell you this quite honestly and frankly – I did not feel that I had the <u>right</u> to say so before I heard from you that, of your own accord, you wanted to come – I <u>really</u> feel, however, that it would not be worth the time & trouble it would cost you, especially if you are not well, to come now – as you would most probably not reach here until Monday night & only Tuesday would be left us – I hope you realize that I am trying to be perfectly</p>
