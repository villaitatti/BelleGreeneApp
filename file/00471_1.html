<p>B.B. – The inevitability and imminence of your leaving, successively benumbs me, freezes me, burns me and causes me to ache with a bitter, intolerable pain –</p>
<p>I have, sometime, idly speculated upon</p>
<p>the particular Hell-on-Earth which undoubtedly awaited me – Is this It? I wonder –</p>
<p>Well – I'm too much in the grip of this malaria to write sanely – and perhaps you are thinking, "death-bed dramatics"</p>
<p>Please – [ <i>double underlined</i> : don't]</p>
<p>Will you come on</p>
