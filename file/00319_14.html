I said certainly and immediately he left – threw them all in the furnace – If you also have received his catalogue, will you let me know if there is <u>anything</u> in it of which you approve? Now I am off to lunch with Kennerley & afterwards am going with a party of friends to have tea & inspect the Vaderland which has just come in – am going to spend the week end at Vassar College Sunday with Thursty who has a cottage there – </p>

<p>always & evermore Your <u>Belle</u></p>
