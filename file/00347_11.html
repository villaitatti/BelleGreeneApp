<p>Now I must stop dear, but of course will write tomorrow – The only days I skip are the week-ends – & then because I am so tired – I am feeling <u>much</u> better. Have been in the water Wagon a long time & have only three vices left (in your <u>absence</u>, only 2) – I love you more than I ever hoped to love any one – More than myself & <u>that</u> is saying a good deal – Don’t forget to return Lady Johnstone's letter & its enclosure as I must send <u>that</u> back to her – Ever your very own adoring <u>Belle </u></p>
