<p>all too short time I have been here. Tomorrow I go to York & Durham then back to London to sail on the Majestic, Sept. 4.</p>
<p>I have been on the trail of English wall-paintings, early English MSS. and English architecture, which, except for the early period is <u>too much for</u> me!</p>
<p>We have seen something of all of these, and I <u>hope</u> that I now have them fixed in my eye</p>
