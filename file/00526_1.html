<p>Thursday 4 March 1926</p>
<p>B.B. darlint –</p>
<p>Sure its the lazy hussy I am not to have written you before, but I’ve been just about</p>
<p>as quiet (without any of the leisure and peace of mind) as a squirrel in a mechanically revolving cage. Three quarters of all Europe is here – and I’m fed up with all of them except the English – who as always are divine. My best English beau has been over for six weeks – but has gone down to Washington for a few days, which gives me a chance to rest up on the emotions. If it were not that he has a title, I’d think of marrying him some day – but <u>even I</u> – can’t make that much of a fool of herself. My dear old Esme</p>
<p>Howard (who is now our ambassador over here) is very keen for it all & gives us many a chance – but <u>truly</u> , I don’t know what has got into the muddled minds of the males these days – Not a darn one of them wants to do anything except marriage. They probably are afraid of being sued – As you see I'm growing senile – and oh! B.B – the other day, I was made to feel one <u>billion</u> years old, by having a boy of <u>23</u> propose matrimony, with or without the benefit of clergy – I never thought I’d come to that – but honest to Gawd – I had no idea how young he was – (he is damned <u>unattractive</u> physically)</p>
<p>The kid was so amazingly, infernally brilliant & had done so much and been in so many of the far away corners of the world, that I thought <u>surely</u> he was 32 at least</p>
