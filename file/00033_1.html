<p>Monday <u>July</u> 19</p>
<p>I have two letters from you today – one sent care of Alice Ditson, the second dated July 9 – They are both dear to me </p>
<p>As Altman is uppermost in my mind I will speak of him first. You may or may not know that I intensely and thoroughly dislike and distrust Duveen – To my positive knowledge he holds A. – in the hollow of his hand – and you will always have to bear this in mind in your dealings with Altman – The last time I saw A. – he spoke to</p>

<p>me at length, quite seriously, and as far as I could make out, quite frankly about his aim in forming a collection and his desire to have the Italian (Early) School well-represented. Although he did not mention your name I knew he had you in mind because he was <u>quite</u> anxious to know whom <u>I</u> considered the authority – I told him that I thought it was generally conceded that you were – He immediately agreed with me and with apparent relief – and said something quite flattering about you which I at this moment, forget. I think that in so far as “civilizing” him (personally) is concerned</p>
