<p>when I know that you are writing to and hearing from everyone else in America I cannot see how you miss <u>my</u> letters in particular – It is unquestionably true that I am not much more than a side issue in you life – and that I am not objecting to and never have since I first completely realized it – then why pray tell me, do you expect <u>me</u> to give up all my time and thought to you? and why is it necessary for me to write you every day for you to be assured that I love you? Everyone else knows I do and more or less pities me for any “forlorn hope” just as they probably pity you for liking me although everyone also seems to realize how much less I am in your life than you are in mine – However, I don’t want to continue in this strain – As to Fricks [sic] Bellini (the St. Francis from Knoedler and Colnaghi) I personally</p>
