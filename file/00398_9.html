<p>in writing this a dozen times I am to see Uncle Henry this afternoon about the Bronzes, Enamels & Maiolica but I don't think we will <u>ever</u> agree on the price.</p>
<p>Did I tell you that I think of buying Voynich's Italian manuscript the one he attributes to Giotto & which I asked you to look at when Gruel had it? I want the Finiguerra badly but perhaps as a <u>book</u> the Giotto is more necessary for me – Voynich did extraordinary business over here, sold everything he had but those two mss. & made himself exceedingly popular. He has been lecturing at all the Universities Museums & libraries –</p>
<p>Now that I am behaving like a perfect lady again – do begin writing daily – I am feeling better but do not gain any weight, which is a nuisance – I'm the boniest & thinnest woman in captivity – as always – my dearest love to you – Your Belle</p>
