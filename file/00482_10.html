<p>been, in our short acquaintance</p>
<p> <u>endlessly</u> kind to me – Unfortunately I cannot see <u>where</u> I can help – I have spoken to J.P. who promises to take it up when he goes over and drop a tactful word into an useful ear – am seeing Harvey (our new ambass – a <u>mess</u> ) tomorrow and will speak to him – Perhaps he can help by <s>speaking of</s> spreading the idea in the right quarter, that Witt is highly esteemed here for his work in connection with the Nat. Gall. etc. I am much afraid of doing something which will prove to be more harmful than helpful – I <u>hope</u> he gets it & wish I could help – <u>Do</u> let me know if you can think of any way in which I can be <u>useful</u> –</p>
<p>Truly I must be growing <u>very</u> </p>
