<p>some adorable lingerie which I am getting for the trousseau of my young sister Teddy – She is to be married some time next year & after I get <u>her</u> off my hands Mother & I will be able to roam about the world as we please & unhampered – and then I came home to tea with my dear Pollard – I dare say you do not know him & would not be interested in his job – He his [sic] the head of the <u>Library</u> (printed books) at the British Museum – and when I tell you that he stammers frightfully & still I <u>adore</u> him</p>

<p>you can jolly well believe that he is attractive. He has just gone & in a few minutes I must run and dress for dinner with the Greys – the Morgan’s are to be there which I fear will greatly interfere with my entertaining qualities [^and “cramp” my style^] for nice & really <u>very</u> nice as they are to me, I always feel “in the presence” so to speak – He is being very grand here – & the papers are making much of a recent private audience with the Kirk – I don’t doubt he finds America a bit tame after treading all the red carpet that is</p>
