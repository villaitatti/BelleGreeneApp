<p>with you then – I <u>should</u> like to feel that before you went away we were at least <u>started</u> on the road to friendship – This is a very frank letter but I think you understand me well enough to understand <u>it</u>. Why don’t you come & have tea with <u>me</u> some day? – Also just <u>when</u> are your daughters coming. I want to be sure to keep some time open to see them –</p>
<p>Sincerely yours,</p>
