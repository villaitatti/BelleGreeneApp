<p>to tell you – but in my next –</p>
<p>Can't this be just a <u>love letter</u> – please – a sort of Vita Nuova one? –</p>
<p>It's curious, but I have also a stronger <u>physical</u> desire (almost) than before – I do want to be whole nights just quietly in your arms – Is that strange? & do you think I had better psychoanalyze it?</p>
<p>Now I want this to catch tomorrow's boat so will close it up – I can't (and won't) promise to write at all regularly – but that I shall write soon again, I do promise</p>
<p>I feel a thousand years old & at the same time like a frightened "debutante" – the Library & Mr. Jack are going splendidly – He is crazy about it & is allowing me to buy new things & discard the bad ones – My life belongs to you B.B. dear. So <u>do</u> love me. Your Belle</p>
