<p>Wednesday</p>
<p> <u>12:30</u> </p>
<p>Dear B.B. –</p>
<p>The tickets are <u>quite</u> alright – I will meet you in the Stateroom, one or the other as they are adjoining – I am sorry about this</p>
<p>afternoon, but I am having a “financier” for tea at 5:15 and he will probably not leave before I have to dress for dinner (an early one 7:30) would you like to telephone me about 6:30 or 6:45? –</p>
<p>I had hysterics over</p>
