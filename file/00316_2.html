<p>though I were by your side in Santa Maria, and oh! B.B. how <u>much</u> I long to be with you all the time! It is pretty certain that I cannot get away this summer – <u>but</u>  <s>for</s> at least two months next year, I intend to spend in Europe – without fail.</p>
<p>Read (or rather the Olympic) arrived bright and early this morning, after a very fine passage. I have spent most of the day with him – We had a long long talk at the Library in the afternoon and then I motored him out to the country for tea – We got back at 7 and dined (or rather ate, very quietly and <u>undressedly</u> at Sherrys. –</p>
<p>I am rather appalled by his appearance – He seems at least ten years older – much thinner and rather tired looking. I did my best to cheer and brighten him up and he was almost a new man by the time I left him – He does not seem to have any <u>definite</u> idea of what Jack M. expects him to do so I have arranged an interview for tomorrow morning. I shall write</p>
