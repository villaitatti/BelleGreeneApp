<p>Thursday morning –</p>
<p>I have just received your enchanting letters from Portugal. What a delightful experience that was for you and how <u>you</u> would appreciate it – the post cards were <u>most</u> illuminating – How absurd for you to ask me to write you what <u>I do</u> – which is of <u>no</u> consequence whatever! I go to a luncheon party & a dinner party every day – I automobile</p>
<p>most every afternoon – I flirt & I study Italian & bookbinding now that I have gotten back to a sane life – I meet some people whom I love and lots whom I detest – I scratch and am scratched and all this is of <u>no</u> consequence to one like you who is touring the Earth – When – if ever – I do any thing worth while I will let you know – until then I will write you of what is behind the curtain of my mind – your commands to the contrary notwithstanding –</p>
<p>I am glad to say that</p>
