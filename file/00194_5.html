<p>of whom everyone is already making sport.</p>
<p>I am anxious to see it compare the <u>type</u> of suffragists with that of the <u>antis</u> . also I’m thinking of joining their ranks – I had a fine cable from J. P. telling me what a splendid time he had in Venice</p>
<p>and wishing I had been with him – Unfortunately I’m very wise to all that.</p>
<p>It’s horrid to be “wise” to anything and there’s nothing I envy so much as a deaf, dumb & blind fool –</p>
<p>Your letter made me feel that we were millions of miles apart and I don’t feel like writing any more for the present</p>
<p>so au revoir Belle.</p>
