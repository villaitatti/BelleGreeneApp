<p>Dearest B.B. –</p>
<p>Today after a week crammed with giddinesses, I am staying in bed – and have read your letter of the 16thhere – It's rather sweet even although you do not say <u>anything</u> sweet – but perhaps you mean some?</p>
<p>I’ve just come out of a harrowing 6 months emotional debauch – I pray the dear god of such things that he will “call it a day” and leave me in peace for the rest of my life on this earth – I’ve had all of it I want and can stand – and feel exactly as if I had been <u>skinned</u> – and am so raw that I must be wrapped up in soothing oil and cotton for a long time before I can again be touched without its causing agony – I’m sure that sounds theatrical – I wish it were not so damned true!</p>
