<p>not now interest me any longer, a Dr. Edmund Deval – He is an intimate friend of the Woodrow Wilsons and I think would like to marry the eldest daughter, Margaret – Save for a lot of Washington gossip & his delicious Southern accent I was not much interested – This afternoon I tead with Mrs. Kearney Warren, a life long friend of Mr. Morgan, <u>82</u> but still going to all the teas, dances & dinners in New York. I love her & she likes me, to such an extent that when I came away, she insisted upon presenting me with a hideous lady of Dresden ware – I dropped it out of my car, in Central Park – Kennerley & I motored down to the café “Mon Plaisir” which is on Long Island – and here I am!</p>
<p>Agoness telephoned just as I was leaving the library asking me to lunch tomorrow – fortunately I was engaged and for <u>every</u> day this week – so she regretfully said she would call me up on Monday. If no one I like, fills me with luncheon dates next week, I’ll just have to invite them to invite me, for I am quite too cross with her to see her. She seemed, over the telephone, <u>utterly</u> unaware of her conduct & my feelings on Saturday which pleased me a bit – Now goodnight dear. Until tomorrow.</p>
<p>Your Belle</p>
