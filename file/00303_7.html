<p>darling for taking me to see them and I hope I’ll get over the craze soon for I see so many things I should like to own. Now I must run as I am expecting some “librarian” people in a few minutes and must be polite to them even although I have no opinion of them. I surely ought to have a letter from you by Monday. It is dreadful to be, both without you and without word from you. I do hope you have written in as great</p>
<p>detail as I and as often. I will send this by tomorrow’s boat – I am dining with the Ledyard’s tonight and fear boredom – I love him but she does not interest me – By the way, Joe Duveen told me that it was Allan Marquand, who said that Mrs. Gardner’s Rossellino was a forgery – She certainly is a nuisance – Siren said he would send me the advance sheets of a number of articles he is publishing – I was as nice to him as I could be and have an idea that I would like him better as a <u>person</u> than as an art critic. I told</p>

<p>him that he seemed to have taken Boston by storm so he told me if all his entertainment there especially of a dinner or luncheon given to him by the Trustees of the Museum – From his account of this festive occasion I found him by no means lacking in humour – Now I want to ask you two things – Have you any <u>definite</u> idea of what he is gunning for over here <u>and</u> is he in the <u>employ</u> of Duveen. I certainly gathered from bits of conversation that he was – If so in what field? I imagine it <u>might</u> be Italian sculpture, but I am not sure as he seems to find most things of the late VX & early XVI century too sweet and weak – I shall ask him in for tea some afternoon & see if I can get anything out of him. He told me that he would like to know Blumenthal better. I think his only value is that he has the capability of making people <u>like</u> him personaly [sic] – I think also that he has good natural taste. He was quite enthusiastic in his praises of Martin as a pioneer. All my dear love to you and my whole heart. Ever Your Belle</p>
