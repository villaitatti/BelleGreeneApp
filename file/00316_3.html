<p>you about everything while they are here, but I very much fear it will bore you. How I wish that it were you, my Beloved dear and that this whole glorious surpassingly beautiful month of May were to be <u>ours</u></p>
<p>But I try not to think of it – I only know that I cannot bear to go with him to any place that you and I especially enjoyed – He seems somewhat inclined for a flirtation which idea really bores me. As I always told you he does not "put me way up in the air"</p>

<p>as you do – nor does he give me any new ideas or range of thought – but he is nice and kind and fatherly and I think a friend. I almost laughed aloud when I first saw Murray again after 3 years. He seems to have grown downwards and is <s>more</s> shorter and more bow-legged than ever. I have not talked with him much but already I feel a decided dis-inclination for his Society – there is something about him I don't like</p>
