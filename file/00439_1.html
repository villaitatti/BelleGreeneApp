<p>Dear B.B.</p>
<p>Yours of Oct. 6 has just reached me – the delay being caused, I imagine by the strike of the shipyard workers here – I wrote you a screed millions of pages long <s>over</s> several weeks ago but I daresay the strike was on then so I don't know <u>when</u> you will receive it – There are 6000 bags of mail tied up in the steamers standing</p>
