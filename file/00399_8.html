<p>anxiety & uncertainty Wilson is certainly making a jackass of himself. Long letter from Read yesterday ridiculing our wobbling position & declaring the government is playing into the hands of Germany – You really cannot blame them all for despising us. I hope your letters will now be longer and fuller. The one from Rome breathed your old love for me – I could not <u>bear</u> to lose <u>that</u> Let me know if I can do anything for you here – Are you going to put our adorable Saturnino Gatti (??) in your new book – Without any apparent reason I dislike the so called "Bellini" more & more every day & have relegated the dreadful thing <u>signed</u> Johannes Bellinus to the cellar where I hope to have it joined <u>soon</u> by Murrays Raphael. All my devoted love to you – Belle</p>
