<p>Dearest B.B –</p>
<p>I have just received your letters of the 9 & 11 – and am <u>so</u> glad you are having a splendid time as well as the rest and change you need – you call it a “pis-aller”!but I find for some reason or other which honestly I cannot explain that everything in life, with perhaps the exception of one’s work <u>is</u> </p>
<p>[p. 2]</p>
<p>a pis-aller – Its [sic] distressing & makes me want to chuck the whole game sometimes</p>
<p>My so-called “grand” people are (naturally) interesting to me, but I would much prefer they were the so-called “smart” set here & not the so very grand ones – Dukes, Lords etc as I don’t believe they will <u>last</u> – or rather that <u>I</u> will last with them – although they are so simple (seemingly) & so kind there is a certain pace of form which envelopes them all & which makes me feel <u>appallingly</u> </p>
