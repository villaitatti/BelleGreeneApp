<p> <u>Tuesday, July 7</u> </p>
<p>Dearest B. B. –</p>
<p>Please be a <u>darling</u> & forget all the horrid, nasty & <u>beastly</u> letter I wrote you yesterday. I hereby withdraw it all – I guess my little tummy must have been out of order. Today is horrid & rainy, but I am rather glad of it as it has prevented so many people from coming to the Library. I don’t feel much like writing except to say that I love and adore you and could hug you to death Your <u>Belle</u> </p>
