<p>with S – today – a good deal about you. He told me as a great secret that you were to make the Walters catalogue. I am anxious to know see what you – will make of some of the material there. His talk was very amusing and instructive & I shall store it all away in my mind until some future day when it may prove useful – Tomorrow he is going to bring me a letter from you about the Raphael which he says he received from you several weeks ago. I suppose you are now personally conducting Altman I learn that he is investigating his supposed Frans Hals (the one that hung in his dining room) I have also been told that there is no doubt that it is a modern forgery & that there is a possibility of the sale transaction being traced back to Bode – of course you will not let Altman know I have any inkling of all this. I asked S – today why [double-underlined: he] didn’t “go” for Bode – that</p>
