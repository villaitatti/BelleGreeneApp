<p>swimmingly on Saturday – I spent the entire morning from ten until one o’clock with him and we (at least I,) had a fine time. We went through the collection of early jade – some of which (about ten examples) were on exhibition and the rest, about 3 dozen pieces, down in one of the vaults. There were two or three pieces that were in the same class with mine so far as <u>material</u> goes, but no piece so large or carved in any way – although I am not sure that the carving <u>adds</u> particularly to the beauty of the material or object. There were three large round discs that they called “badges of rank” that I fell desperately in love with, they were delicious in shape and texture and colouring – one was the colour of wine “dead leaves” Lodge said they called it, and one beautiful specimen was a golden colour lightly specked with green Then there were a few little running animals and some weapons or flint knives. While downstairs in the vault, Lodge showed me some Chinese <u>glass</u> – perfectly vile</p>
