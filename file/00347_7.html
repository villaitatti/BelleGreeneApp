<p>my mind about the <u>apartment</u> idea. When I wrote, I had in mind two very charming rooms and both on my Street (one block further west) in a delightful private house which is a sort of bachelor haven – The rent is about £30 a week ($150.00) but it could doubtless be had for less – of course I could not visit you there unless you had other people – but there is no need for that, as my apartment is so near – You could only have your <s>ber</s>  <u>breakfast</u> served you, but the Murray</p>
<p>[p. 11]</p>
<p>Hill Hotel is directly opposite and in any case, you would be dining or lunching out every day – if nowhere else then with me – There is a very charming sitting room where you could see people on business – but it lacks a good many of the <u>efficient</u> conveniences of an Hotel.</p>
<p>If you prefer rooms in an hotel, the Murray Hill is fairly good & fairly cheap but <u>not</u> so cheap</p>
<p>(for the size of [sic] comfort of the rooms) as this house opposite it of which I write. In any case I can look around</p>
