<p> <u>June 29, 1920</u> </p>
<p>Dear B.B. –</p>
<p>I was delighted to have your letter of June 14th. I would <u>much</u> rather have you wait until you “well up” or “over” before writing me – It’s more natural, the letter is more readable and I am more ‘interested.’</p>
<p>I am very glad that you have made arrangements for staying in Carl Hamilton's apartment – and am sure you will be infinitely</p>
