<p>make any difference whether I <s>see you</s> write to you or not, but it is God’s truth that you <u>fill</u> my thoughts almost all day and all my waking hours – and I dare say there is scarcely a day in which I do not speak of you to someone – if only to Thursty – so please, please keep to your earlier idea of coming here in October or November – you darling – How I should love to be with you in your sojourn near Rome and wander about with you in all those fascinating places – It seems such ages since I have been anywhere or seen anybody – The days here are just filled by plans for selling and I am <u>so</u> sick of it. I cannot tell you how it depresses me and makes me sick of this business of earning one’s living – In fact I’m thoroughly tired of the business of <u>living</u> – It seems to be of so</p>
