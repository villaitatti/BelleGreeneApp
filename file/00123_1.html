<p>Friday 3 p.m –</p>
<p>Just a line dearest before I send this off for tomorrow’s boat – I have spent almost the whole day closeted with J.P. reading over his will to him – He told me I was the only person outside of his lawyer who had seen it so you will hold this <u>confidential</u> won’t you dear?</p>
<p>Iam about wornout now & am going out to get a bit of luncheon – <u>Don’t</u> miss a day inwriting me dearwill you? It is so <u>wonderful</u> to think you have not missed one yet –</p>
<p>Is it wise for me to repeat how much I love you – the telling of it will bore you I fear –</p>
<p>Ever & ever & ever</p>
<p> <u>your</u>  <u>Belle</u> .</p>
