<p>Tuesday Evening Jan. 4</p>
<p>Dear B.B. –</p>
<p>A line in your letter received this morning worries me – "how simple it would all be if I did not care so much for you" –</p>
<p>What do you <u>really</u> mean? I wish I could be certain that my never-absent Egotism were making much of a catch phrase – Somehow I cannot be comfortably <u>sure</u> , and I want you to tell me – (Yes, I know this is incoherent, but that is the way I feel)</p>
<p>With <u>what</u> does your caring for me interfere? <u>How</u> would not caring-at-all simplify your life?</p>
<p>I <u>honestly</u> cannot see that I am anything in it except an ineradicable</p>
