<p>have <u>resumed</u> my plans & will leave here on the 11th – & leave Paris for Rome on the 13th – My stay there however will be cut short as I shall have to come back here in May and see the collection I spoke of, there – It is most important for me to go through it at this time – That means that I will probably have only about 2 weeks in Italy – I may be able to arrange my sailing for a later date & so stay longer – My plans & arrangements have all been horribly mixed up from the beginning and it has kept me in a constant uncertainty which has lost me valuable time everywhere I hope to get in at the Excelsior and I have asked Hyvernat to arrange it for me – Do <u>whatever</u> is quite the easiest thing for you – I have written Hyvernat that I want you to see as many of the illuminations as are available – You know some of the volumes are in such bad condition as to be quite untouchable at this time. You had better address me care of the Vatican [ <i>written on the right-hand margin</i> : Library as I cannot be sure of my hotel. Will write you on my arrival Belle]</p>
