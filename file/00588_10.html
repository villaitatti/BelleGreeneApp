<p>in the last 2 or 3 years, but never found time for – The most depressing, and therefore the truest I dare say, was “Little Man What Now” – I presume the Germans must hate it, but it had a tremendous success in AMurrica –</p>
<p>It’s awfully amusing to me to listen (I am at the Captains table consisting of 10) to <s>their</s> them saying how <u>glad</u> they are to have Americans come to Germany because then they see for themselves how fine wunderbar [^it is^] etc. etc. and not at all [^bad^] as the American papers say and its [sic] <u>too</u> funny to hear them calling Hitler another Mussolini! I can just see Mussolini spitting out of one corner of his mouth if he heard it – but, as I promised before I left, I just smile and don’t say a word –</p>
<p>Now I must stop – as I have lots of other letters to get off – I <u>loved</u> seeing you, and will look forward to seeing you next Summer – <u>Heaps</u> of LUV –</p>
