<p>sorrow is mixed with <u>rage</u> because he would not come to play with me in London when he found I could not get to Paris – I wanted to see him so dreadfully & I had millions, no billions of things to say to him – then I was <u>so</u> distressed about his cold – & your not being well & your troubles with I Tatti that altogether I was about the most miserable person you ever saw – I felt exactly as a drownded [sic] cat <u>looks</u> – I have begged that most adorable lamb B.B. not to go to I Tatti until the end of November & now he tells me that he is trying to get you to go to Madrid with him although you really are not well enough to do so – I <u>do</u> hope you will be able to go or at least persuade him to go – in fact to be <u>absolutely</u>, <u>brutally</u> truthful I wish to God <u>I</u> could go with him – I dread going back to New York & my old life</p>
