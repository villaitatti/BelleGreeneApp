<p>Monday <u>March 13 – 1916</u> </p>
<p>My Belovedest –</p>
<p>I am afraid that I missed a boat on last Thursday. It was not scheduled in the papers, but I heard that one did sail then. I'm sure you can understand that it is almost impossible to keep track of the mails sometimes they only announce them the day before they are going I hope you receive all my letters. This new policy on the part of all the nations, of keeping things quiet sometimes prevents our hearing of <u>all</u> the ships which are sunk – the situation in France looks very grave to me, but I cannot get many people over here to agree with me. They are determinedly optimistic for France. I have been seeing a bit of Ananda Coomaraswamy lately – they arrived here (he & his Cockney wife) about two weeks ago and as he brought letters to me, I called upon them & they both dined with me on last Friday –</p>
