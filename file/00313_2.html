<p>feel like doing <u>anything</u> so I think I’ll get in my car in an hour or so and heat up the country. I suppose Florence, especially I Tatti, must be <u>quite</u> beautiful now – I do envy you for being there – I expect to move out to the country about the middle of May and shall be glad of quiet peaceful nights and the daily motor trip up one hour each way – By the way, Thursty says she sent you a lot of coffee from Sherry’s to the ship, but as she has never heard from you & knows how punctilious you are – she feared you never received it – will you write her if you did?</p>
<p>I shipped the catalogues to you Saturday but <u>very</u> stupidly forgot to put in your Johnson catalogue so I shall have to send that separately – <u>Have you</u> a copy of Laufer’s book on Early <u>jade</u>? Please let me know as I want to send you one if you have not – Oh! B.B. I want you here <u>so</u> much – I miss you in a thousand ways. Do you still love me? Your Belle</p>
