<p>not have as a gift – but I also know that they must have some others, unless they make up their minds to stay in business <u>only</u> for paintings –</p>
<p>Well – I’m buzzing in the head now, so I’ll stop for a while – the thing will be settled with <u>Duveen</u> tomorrow and I’ll write you then. One of the hardships I have is <u>Mr. Jack</u> – If I don’t keep him out of the way, he <u>spoils</u> every deal for me – of course you won’t tell Duveen, but <u>he</u> could have accepted 2 ½ millions from Duveen – In fact I really had to lock him up in the room until <u>I</u> told Duveen that it would not be considered – I’ll write more tomorrow afternoon.</p>
<p>I have <u>no</u> thoughts except this business and <u>you.</u> Your <u>own</u> – <u>Belle</u> </p>
