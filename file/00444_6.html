<p>Place Vendôme as <u>something</u> (God knows what) may turn up to prevent my getting to Rome before May.</p>
<p>Truly this place is a Babylon and I <u>scream</u> with laughter most of the time – anyhow since I decided not to take any of it to mind or heart – but simply to amuse myself by listening to one after another telling me the deep dyed plots, villainies, etc. of everyone else in the world – Thank God I have no relation to the Art world – It's filthier than offal –</p>
<p>My love to you –</p>
<p> <u>Belle</u> </p>
