<p>beloved books and not be bothered with financiers, dealers and <u>ladies</u> – the last named bother me more than all the rest – they are Such <u>damned fools</u> – Why is it every woman who comes within a mile of J. P., immediately loses her head, all sense of dignity and becomes, to all appearances desperately enamoured of him & a willing candidate</p>
<p>for the harem – He seems to bowl them over completely[.] They lose all sense of discretion modesty & even common decency</p>
<p>It disgusts me thoroughly with my sex – It surely is not his fault, for all he does is to sit like a reviewing general & they flock to him all day long in rapid & sickening succession,</p>
<p>Each one pluming her feathers & thinking she is the hen pheasant, when in reality she is forgotten before her successor appears</p>
