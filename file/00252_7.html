<p>P.S. – As I wired you – I learned from the Ritz, that they could <u>not</u> accommodate you <u>at all</u> . I therefore engaged rooms at the <u>Belmont</u> –</p>
<p>42 Street & Park Ave. 2 bedrooms – 2 baths & sitting room – I think these rooms will cost $30 per day</p>
<p>If you do not like</p>
