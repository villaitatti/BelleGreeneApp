<p>with this man, and that since then, Eugene & she had often talked about it and E. had told her <u>very</u> decidedly what he and all other men thought of him and that before she sailed he had told her that she could feel perfectly free about most things but she was <u>not</u> to see, or be seen with this guest as it would hurt <u>her</u> reputation and his (Eugene’s) dignity – so he is way up on his ear this morning. of course I have known for a <u>long</u> </p>
