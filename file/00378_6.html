<p>came to see me yesterday and I asked him exactly what she had done â€“ he told me only the bedrooms etc. upstairs, that Sir Charles Allom had done all the gallery and the rooms downstairs. Frick is going to take me over it in a personally conducted tour on next Saturday when I will describe it to you in detail. I have had to put off my visit to Mrs. George Widener for two weeks as I have so many engagements here for the next few Saturdays</p>
