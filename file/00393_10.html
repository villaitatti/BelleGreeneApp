<p>He has sent Kennerly a lot of junk to be sold at auction – late Ming stuff. And a lot that looks as if it had just left a New Jersey factory. I have bought 4 beautiful small Sung bowls from Yamanaka to be used as ash trays and they are making me some vitrines for my house. They have 2 very fine T'ang camels and a good horse but their prices also are beyond me. Junius Morgan has been here for about three weeks looking awfully well – but he is now becoming restive and wants to return to Paris – He's awfully attractive, more so than ever and he's still awfully good to me – but I think he's pretty well recovered from any case he used to have on me – in fact I know he has – Mother keeps asking</p>
