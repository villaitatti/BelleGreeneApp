<p>Dear B. B. –</p>
<p>I feel like a <u>lark</u> today. The sun is shining for the first time in a week and I am going to motor way out into the country this afternoon</p>

<p>It is rather annoying to find that <u>mere weather</u> makes such a difference in one’s frame of mind but such is the case with me at least – I had become <u>so</u> depressed by two weeks of <u>continuous</u> rain!</p>
<p>There is nothing of interest here except the political situation</p>
