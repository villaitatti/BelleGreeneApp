<p>[p. 6]</p>
<p>I received a four page letter from Meyer-Riefstahl extolling the Sambon Collection & telling me how many friends & acquaintances we had in common – The letter was evidently instigated by Sambon as I never met, nor never heard from Meyer-Riefstahl before. Also a long letter from Rey, which is so badly written I can hardly read it – but he says that Seligmann is howling all over Paris about America being in the clutches of Duveen – and more and still more, all of which you have heard from Seligmann himself</p>
<p>Thursday –</p>
<p>Four times dearest have I tried to write you today – but it is no use. I have not been let alone for a second and now I must go up to the St. Regis to dine in street clothes with Agoness & Read – I <u>hate</u> it – but could not avoid it –</p>
<p>Friday 9:30 a.m –</p>
<p>Although there are shoals of letters on my desk I shall not open one until I write you – Yesterday was such a hectic day I could not write you at all – Read & Murray came at ten o'clock to have a conference</p>
