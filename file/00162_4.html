<p>want to kiss you until it <u>hurts</u> you even –</p>
<p>Daarrling it is <u>such</u> a beastly long time before I shall see you and so long since I <u>have</u> seen you. I wonder if you will love me as much when I come</p>
<p>[p. 8]</p>
<p>back to you? I know I shall love <u>you</u> more – It’s unfair for me to write you such beastly letters when you are so darling about writing to me, but you are not absent from my thoughts <u>one</u> minute – I love & adore you dear & You are more to me than even <u>you</u> know – Ever your</p>
<p><u>Belle</u></p>
