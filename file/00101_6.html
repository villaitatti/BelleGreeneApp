<p>peculiarly tender feeling for him – almost as if I were his mother – I had a long talk with him this afternoon in the library among other things the <s>question</s> [^name^] of Mrs Eugenie Strong came up & we discussed her pretty thoroughly – Read knows the Devonshires very well & he told me how the “new” Duchess had turned Mrs. Strong out of the door etc. etc – but the thing that interested me most was that he had been told by pretty good authority that she was planning to come over here to [ <i>double underlined</i> : live] – & to</p>
<p>lecture, write etc – I <u>was</u> surprised for I had no idea she contemplated more than a visit here –</p>
<p>Lady Johnstone came in yesterday – I saw her today. She looked <u>very</u> handsome & told me she had heard about me from a number of people abroad & had made up her mind she was going to know me very well – I met her in the same spirit as I like her better than any of the rest of the harem</p>
