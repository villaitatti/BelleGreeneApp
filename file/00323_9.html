He told me also all the scandal that was rife about Anne Morgan De Wolfe, Marbury & Castellane in Paris and a long tale that Mrs. Strong had poured into his Ears at dinner one night, upholding Castellane and berating (my) Mr. Morgan for not leaving Anne more money. Read looked so handsome last night that he made me gasp several times. He is quite sunburnt and browned-up & <u>somebody</u> (I suppose Raphael) sent him to a good tailor</p>
<p>and it has improved him 100 per cent – how I must stop darling and send this off by the Carmania. No good boat goes until Saturday but I shall send another by then. Your letters fill me with joy & happiness. I am glad you wrote to Agnes. Did I tell you that Read is bored to <u>death</u> with her & thinks her a silly, inconsequential person – but he loves Eugene. We are all dining at the Ritz tonight & have a farewell bust “ <u>on</u> ” Eugene – My dearest and only love is to you – always.</p>
<p> <u>Your</u> Belle.</p>
