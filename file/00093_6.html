<p>mostbrilliant letter I have <u>ever</u> read – Then she tells me all about all the people she knew – Oscar Wilde & Burne Jones & Holman Hunt and some that I never heard of – Oh! B. B. What a life that woman has had more than dozens of us together will ever have – and her “morals” areenchanting – When I was justhavingher five minutes ago (having talked forthree solid hours) she said “oh! childie come back, I want to ask you something & when I returned to her bed she said very abruptly “How long ago was it that you were so dreadfully in love?” – Well I <u>gasped</u> & fell into a chair – she held me by both hands or I would have run – I said “What on earth do you mean?” & she said – “oh! you can’t fool me, I like you too much & when I <u>really like</u> people they can never fool me –” so I finally told her & she was <u>so</u> insistent upon knowing all about it that I only got away by promising to tell her at least a <u>part</u> tomorrow – Do you supposeevery oneis going to read me like that? She was <u>quite</u> wonderful when she told me about her love for Henry Irving – We were both in tears before she finished – I daresay <u>you</u> think she is old (62) & franzy & foolish but <u>I</u> love her. She is coming to spend the Saturday & Sunday after we land in my flat with me “where” as she says, “we can talk all night” – Williamson nailed</p>
