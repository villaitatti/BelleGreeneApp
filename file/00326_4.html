<p>[p. 7]</p>
<p>I enclose a steamer letter from your friend Agoness. I gave her letters of introduction to Statesbury & some other people on board – Eugene showed me your <u>very</u> dear letter to him</p>
<p>Hes [sic] strong for you – I am too tired to do so today but when I write tomorrow I will “relate you” as Seligmann says, all about him & all – He’s developing an awful crush – <u>but</u> I won’t stand for it – It is too</p>
<p>[p. 8]</p>
<p>long to write of now so more tomorrow –</p>
<p> <u>If</u> I did not love you so completely and <u>if</u> I were not a “perfect lady” I’d cut Agoness out –</p>
<p>Ever Your Adoring</p>
<p>Belle</p>
