<p>[p. 5]</p>
<p>time here – He has an ingratiating manner and a ripping sense of humour. I let him come to the house for tea with me last Sunday – He came at five o’clock and left at ten and he jabbered every minute – He’s really awfully funny about our friend Read and I could not take offense because I think its [sic] true that Read puts in an awful amount of side when in the vicinity of a dealer – M. R. has been astonishingly frank with me about himself and his affairs – I had heard a lot about his wife from Freer, for whom she was a secretary or companion for some years (and from the way Freer spoke I think there was a nearer and dearer relation) He is over here to establish himself in business – but he wants to do it gradually and with the right crowd and as much on the level as possible</p>
