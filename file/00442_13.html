<p>Gimpel has dropped out of the firm here – I expect to see him in Paris as he knows some of the modern painters & sculptures [sic] I want to meet there. </p>
<p>I believe that Duveen has bought a lot of stuff from Austria & that some of the other dealers here are also on that same track –</p>
<p>I don't know what I can tell you about the "Flowerdales" except that George has received the Legion of Honor & Florrie also has some strange & elaborate decoration – It's <u>not</u> Croix de Guerre & that is all I know – They have bought some very fine looking Italians I <u>imagine</u> from Perkins also a curious, Greek looking Italian marble head which I don't much care for, although I may be all wrong indeed – Her house is [<i>underlined twice</i>: too] lovely and I simply adore it – You may not care for it – but for once, I don't care whether you do or not – <u>I</u> simply revel in a thousand and one aspects of it –</p>
