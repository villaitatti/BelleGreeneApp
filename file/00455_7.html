<p>and have seen only a few men friends & one or two girls –</p>
<p>I have not seen the show at the Metropolitan and am amazed to hear that practically little was said about the various pictures and exhibits –</p>
<p>If you are now in Paris will you go to Kelekian and look at four leaves from a Byzantine manuscript about the 13 cent for me? They represent the 4 Evangelists & I liked the St. John, but</p>

<p>there is [ <i>double underlined</i> : something] peculiar about them – At least they left me very undecided – If you approve of them I will buy them <s>fa</s> for the Library even although they are so late. The colouring is quite peculiar & I should be inclined to think there was an Armenian influence there. However, I only saw them for a few moments – He also has a nice – <u>very</u> nice, rug but I daresay that would not interest you</p>
<p>I asked Read send you a copy of his book– he has been a <u>wonderful</u> friend</p>

<p>to me & I do wish you two were friends & told him so – but it is quite natural if you never come together as you are [^of^] so widely differing temperaments</p>
<p>I only received my little picture yesterday. They took it away from me at our Customs House here as I did not have a “statement from the artist who painted it” – Let me warn you not to bring any such trifles in with your baggage – or they make a <u>frightful</u> </p>

<p>row here – it is much safer to ship them  – although I hear there is a huge export duty on all works of art <s>of</s> from Italy – and of course it is practically impossible now to get anything from France – I think the new French law will resolve itself into the formality of the Italian law – I did not see Seligmann while I was last in Paris, but heard he was raging about like a bull –</p>
<p>As I say I have been entirely out of things since my return. Have only been at the <s>hospital</s> </p>

<p>Library three days & then was not well enough to see any one, so I have neither news nor gossip to pass on –</p>
<p>I’m disgusted (personally) with the conduct of the Republicans in convention in Chicago – Harding is, I understand, a rather sane & conservative man, but rather a tool of Lodge  – Anything however was preferable to Johnson Wood or Lowden – I am keen to see who will run on the Democratic ticket – However I am firmly convinced that <u>no</u> Democrat could win</p>

<p>this year –</p>
<p>I’ll try to find time to write you toward the end of this week– I am going to Newport on Friday to stay with the Bakers & see some of the trial yacht races – I do hope that Bounder Tipton gets wiped off the yacht racing map for good – J.P is Commodore this year, so we are much excited about the races.</p>
<p>My love to you B.B. dear – There are two "roughnecks" here who are trying to spoil this–</p>
<p>Ever Your</p>
<p>Belle</p>
