<p>rather brilliant talk à la show – but the third act petered out sickeningly – There were lots of regular “first-nighters'' there whom I know and during the acts we had some red hot war discussions. Really the way some of the people talk here almost makes me violently pro-German. They are so sickeningly sentimental and pay no attention whatever to the facts, or the real significance of true struggle.</p>
