<p>up in love affairs but they are all sailing now or I am gone so one hears no more. Your friend Miss Marbury asked a friend of mine if <u>she</u> thought I would ever marry – My friend said she didn’t know – I <u>do</u> wish they could mind their own business</p>
<p>for at least a <u>little</u> while – The Lord knows [ <i>triple underlined</i> : nothing] concerning that crowd interests me & <u>why</u> should my affairs interest them? I’ll paralyze them by marrying J. P. some fine day – <u>Wouldn’t</u> it be a beautiful scandal? I don’t expect him back,</p>
