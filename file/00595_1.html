<p>Mr. W.M. Ivins, Jr.</p>
<p>Woodbury, Connecticut</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Wal-Dung:</p>
<p>Why could you not choose a more aromatic alias?</p>
<p>In re the enclosed and your last communication, also your lecture – What have <u>you</u> done in the last 30,000 years? There is quite a bit I could say about the enclosed but I will exercise my usual and well-known ladylike restraint and only say – why not take someone your own size to kick downstairs? You can interpret “size” physically, intellectually, complimentarily or otherwise, as you wish.</p>
<p>Why not let sleeping lions lay? When disturbed in their slumber they are apt to bite and chew.</p>
<p>However, like B.B. (as you say) this outburst is “covered full of love and affection and all the amenities of the season” including the smallpox –</p>
<p>Sincerely yours,</p>
<p>(Sgd.) Belle da Costa Greene</p>
