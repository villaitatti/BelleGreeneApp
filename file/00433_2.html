<p>Niagara Falls. <s>On</s> [^By^] Friday last I was obliged to give it up – as I was a mental&physical <u>wreck</u> – and simply could not do another thing. I have also resigned from some Naval League work and now can do no active work except to raise money for a Cavalry division in which my young brother-in-law is an officer. He expects to be in France before this letter reaches you and we are planning to ship them clothing&food supplies every two weeks as long as they (the men) last – I have half <s>ed</s> promised Mr. Davison to go back to the Red Cross work in January if I feel strong enough – we raised one hundred million dollars in one week and must do the same again in January – also our new Liberty loan comes in then and I suppose, as usual, I shall be called upon to campaign</p>
