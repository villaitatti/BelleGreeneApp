<p>verymuch interested lately in the work of one John Masefield – an Englishman – who to me is quite <u>splendid</u> – Have you read any of his things? “The Tragedy of Man” – The Widow in <s>the</s> Bye Street”</p>
<p>The Everlasting Mercy –</p>
<p>[p. 10]</p>
<p> <u>Please</u> do, if you have not, and tell me what you think of them –</p>
<p>Also do you know what Oscar Wilde actually died of – was it meningitis or some aggravated form of syphilis? I listened to a hot debate on the subject the other night – but find my two biographies of him</p>
