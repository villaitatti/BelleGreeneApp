<p>I have had such enchanting letters from Mr. Read about their Egyptian trip and Mrs. Hamilton is bubbling over with enthusiasm about it – I am dying to hear all about it from his own dear mouth –</p>
<p>Beloved I cover your face with kisses and I would you were here that I might rest upon your heart – write me every thing about yourself – all that you do and see – I am always greedy for news of you – I may not be able to write for over a week so forgive me in advance –</p>
<p>Your Belle</p>
