<p>had said to him about me, which as you can imagine did not compliment me very much – but it showed how thick he was with said Joe – I tried to make him at ease with me, but <s>he</s> could see be was not – I don’t think he has much wickedness in him naturally, but I very much fear he will be made so by Duveen and the others. I don’t think he will ever telephone me, he’s always promising and begging but never comes to the scratch. He wanted to know what I thought of Siren but I was <u>very</u> careful there. said he seemed to be a charming young man but I had only seen him once and hoped to see more of him – He praised him to the skies and I was careful not to controvert him at all – It is after one o’clock now dear – so I must say goodnight – I am missing you so very much and yet am, in a way happy about you – I feel very confident of your love for me and your loyalty to me and nobody but <u>yourself</u> can ever make me doubt it – I hope you feel <u>now</u> the same way about me – All me love and kisses – Belle</p>
