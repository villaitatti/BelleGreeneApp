<p>today who interested me immensely – I brought him back to the Library and altogether spent four hours with him and yet for the life of me cannot exactly recall his name, I think it is Hendicourt, but am not sure – He is a Frenchman and an amateur of fine things. He spotted the <u>best</u> things at the Library <u>at once</u> and loved them. Do you know him at all? It seems he is a close friend of that “near-dealer” Maurice de Rothschild – but he is <u>really very</u> attractive – on a <u>first</u> acquaintance</p>
