<p>‘Well, this time I don’t intend to have him on my hands after business hours” “Nor I,” said Jack – now that I know him I don’t have to invite him to visit me at the house” – Pretty significant I thought – I shall be anxious to hear all that you are doing in England – Don’t forget to let me know if you see an A1 head (Chinese) and I will at once sell my motor, or the shirt on my back to get it – Do you remember the little Sarengetti Murray had? Do you think it very fine? And what do you think is its value – He still has it & he asked me in a letter received this morning if I still liked it as much as I had before his sale – I think his idea is to offer it to me [<i>double underlined</i>: very] cheap. I enclose part of his letter referring to his picture sale as I think his frankness about it, is amusing – Please return. Tell me if it bores rather than interests you to have me send you these enclosures – You see my world is so small and yours so large that it may seem ridiculous to you</p>
