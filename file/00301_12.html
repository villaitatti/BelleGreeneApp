<p>[p. 18]</p>
<p>repeat and distort in repeating to your friend Mrs. G. Some day I am going to plan to see her face to face, when there are plenty of witnesses present and tell her a <u>few plain</u> truths that I think will surprise her; but I shall not do it until there are plenty of people handy to hear what I have to say! Lunched [^today^] with a youth I know named Slater – he had there a warm and frizzled but bright & chirpy little female named Ms. Grace Woods who said she knew you years ago in Paris (I <u>think</u> she said you were around 18 at the time!) and that you had all more or less lived in each others lives, Clyde Fitch being of the group – she was quite ecstatic in her praises of you and thought you quite the most wonderful being in the world. Perhaps you will not recognize her by this name and I did not have the gall to ask her maiden name. She is some sort of an interior decorator – Now I must run dear – my brain is addled & I love – adore – worship <u>you</u> but am <u>terribly</u> sick of this letter. Do you miss me? I do you but not so much as I did en route to & in Boston. I am – Your</p>
<p>Belle</p>
