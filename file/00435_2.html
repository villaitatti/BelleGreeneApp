<p>wavering <u>very</u> much in any desire to go to Europe. Most of the people I know who have been over there lately have pretty well discouraged me about going – Every American who writes to me from there is frightfully impatient to get back to these fairly comfortable states. Then too every one tells me that the travel is so deucedly disagreeable every where and that difficulties are constantly being put in ones path, <u>if</u> they do not already exist – Thepurchase of the Yates Thompson manuscripts I can do equally well by letter and cable and that was always only an excuse for going over. I <u>would</u> like to see a lot of people in England and the few in know or would meet in</p>

<p>Paris or Italy but I doubt if the starvation and inconvenience would not overbalance the pleasure – I am sure everything will be infinitely better in 6 months time – so that I may defer my trip to September or even to the Spring of 1920 –</p>
<p>Far be it from me, at my advanced age – to <u>seek</u>  <s>trouble</s> physical discomfort – I am a bit concerned about our Coptic manuscripts at the Vatican but I can send Hyvernatover to take care of those.</p>
<p>Now that the war (in so far as actual, physical battling is concerned) is over, we are frightfully messed up here in consideration of the world</p>

<p>after the war – the League of Nations – Bolshevikism and Labor –</p>
<p>Even <s>with my</s> my material and "acting-instead-of-thinking" self can understand your desire to be apart from it all and one with the rocks and trees – Do you suppose there has <u>ever</u> been one worth while person who has not had that desire?</p>
<p>In Amurrica, however, one <u>cannot</u> get away from the bang and clash & clatter of it all – Only when I am safely locked up all alone in the Library do I cease to worry it all to bits. Of course we have all been so bedevilled & maddened by our great W.W. – <s>that</s> we cannot see the League of Nations as we should and realize the great ideal back of it</p>
