<p>clubs and inns around here where I have been taken for lunch and tea and last night we had a ball at Mrs. Goddard’s where every one wore Revolutionary or Colonial dress – I should love to stay here longer but I have a great many things calling me back to town. So back I must go tomorrow in time for a Pelleas & Melisande rehearsal. Have you heard the opera? I have not as yet. but I <u>love</u> to go to the rehearsal’s [sic] – there is an electric atmosphere which makes the whole performancethrob</p>
<p>and pulsate. I have been seeing a good deal of the musical Crowd this year & fell desperately in love (for a short time) with our new French tenor Edmond Clément</p>
<p>He is one of the most finished artists I have ever heard & has a fascinating personality, and that light touch in conversation which is So agreeable.</p>
<p>I really deserve the little scolding you gave me in your letter of Feb. 10th from London but the only way I can give you a detailed account of my life</p>
