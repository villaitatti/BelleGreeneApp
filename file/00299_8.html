<p>let on that I had seen the originals merely that you & I had looked at the photographs also –</p>
<p>Agoness is crazy about an awful “plain” bronze bowl for $1500 that I did not want to look at twice – Also she thinks I’m nutty about my jade – All this over the telephone. She’s wild to have a confab with me but I had no time.</p>

<p>Arrived o.k. am at the Copley Plaza as the Chilton Club was all filled up – It’s a nice hotel, rather English good service & very quiet – Feel awfully lonely. I read Binyon’s “Painting in the Far East” on the train and liked it immensely – I quite love his attitude toward the whole thing and his sympathetic and “soulful” approach He is quite mad over Freer’s things in fact the book is dedicated to Freer and he says that </p>
