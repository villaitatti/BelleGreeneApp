<p>I have a delightful <u>looking</u> book which Witt recommended “Les vers darés de Pythagore” and the Guérard is still on my conscience –</p>
<p>Tomorrow night I am dining and going on a <u>most</u> respectable party with the Martin Egan’s – Eleanor has just returned from 6 months in China where she went to look over the starving millions and make them known to the world – I love them</p>
<p>[p. 20]</p>
<p>both – Am not going away until the 8th of August, and am treating myself to a little discipline the first step being this evening of absolute solitude.</p>
<p>Have lost most of my hard earned weight – If I <u>ever</u> see you again, I’ll tell you all that has arrived between me and my “Lady-beau” I don’t want to <u>write</u> any more about it as you <u>insist</u> upon keeping</p>
