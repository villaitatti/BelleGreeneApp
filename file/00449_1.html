<p>Monday, Apr. 19</p>
<p>Dear B.B –</p>
<p>Permit me, in the name of All the Holy Fathers (the only people I know here!) to welcome you to the Holy City – which I adore.</p>
<p>I'm sorry that I am tied up at the Vatican tomorrow (Tuesday) morning with Gasquet and Mercati and they <u>seem</u> </p>
<p>to be so darned important that I don't dare change it. You see I had expected to spend <u>Monday</u> morning with you and so had made my professional duties wait over until Tuesday –</p>
<p> <u>Therefore</u> please sleep <u>all</u> tomorrow morning as you will be exhausted from your journey and come here to lunch with me at 1:15 – I have kept the afternoon free for "us"</p>
