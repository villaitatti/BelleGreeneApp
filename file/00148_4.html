<p>evidently changed her plans for she has just cabled me that she is sailing for home this Saturday. News which bores me <u>terribly</u>. I <u>was</u> enjoying her absence so much although I <u>do</u> like her – the Blumenthals sailed today. I think you are wrong and that, contrary to being malicious she will prove to be a great friend to me. I have given up all festivities & the most I do is an occasional luncheon or dinner with however only people <u>above your reproach</u>. I have not yet received my painting will you please let me know through whom you sent it – I think I shall cable you about this tomorrow.</p>
<p>All my love to you daarrling and always remember I love you and <u>only</u> you – <u>Your</u> Belle –</p>
