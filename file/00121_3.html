<p>appearance of my dear Ellen Terry – You must know her – she is such amischiefous[sic] darling – I had a rather interesting letter from Gordon Craig about his magazine The Mask – He must be rather a clever man –</p>
<p>I feel rather stale, flat & unprofitable today &</p>
<p>[p. 6]</p>
<p>am sure you find this letter the same so far, so I will leave it until tomorrow as it will not go anyhow before Saturday <u>Beloved</u> I <u>love thee Belle</u> </p>
