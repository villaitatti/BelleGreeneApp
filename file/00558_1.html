<p>Dear B.B</p>
<p>I am [<i>underlined in pen: </i><u>really</u>] very sorry that your letter of January the thirtieth has not been answered before this, but I have been completely deluged by Library matters, and all the bothersome details connected with the Supplementary Library building which Mr Morgan is erecting adjoining this one; and have besides, been in such beastly health that whenever possible I go to bed directly upon reaching home.</p>
<p>The reason I did not send you a copy of the Roxburghe publication earlier, is that there were so very few of them left (we decided not to sell any) that I had to see Mr Morgan about the distribution of most of the six remaining copies. I find [<i>inserted in pen:</i> ,] as of course I expected, that he is delighted to send you a copy, without any question of whether it is a final Harvard disposition o<s>f</s>[<i>edited in pen:</i>r] not; we will ship it in a few days, and trust that it will reach you safely.</p>
<p>I am enjoying one of my annual colds at the moment, and just as soon as I feel less stuffy, I will sit down and write you a long personal letter.</p>
<p>Ever devotedly yours,</p>

<p>P.S. Do you mind sending a line of acknowledgement [<i>underlined in pen: </i><u>to Mr Morgan</u>] when the book reaches you?</p>
