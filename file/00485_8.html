<p>with the Halseys – He is one of the “lesser” trustees of the museum and I like him in a non-excitable, friendly way – but <u>she</u> interests me enormously as she is an undoubted medium – They are scientifically investigating her at the Rockefeller now – de Novy told me their side of it – but I am anxious to hear hers – she is going to do some stunts with me next face – that is she <u>says</u> so – but she is endlessly vague (except in appearance!) and invariably forgets <u>in toto</u> everything she promises. </p>
<p>Return to the Library tomorrow morning and hope to find a letter from you – Gimpel wrote me that Mrs. Gardner asked him or the price of his St. Paul “En Cas” – as J. P. Has finally & definitely said he cannot buy – I hope she gets it – Your lazy <u>Belle</u></p>
