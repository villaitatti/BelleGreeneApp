<p>ourselves, just you and I alone, without our very kind and very well meaning but not always understanding friends – and I really hate to go away leaving our relations as they are – To be sure had you come, we might have completely wrecked them, but on the other hand, we <u>might</u> have completely mendedthem – at least we could have known each others heart, which is <u>so</u> difficult to do via letters; besides I wanted to talk to you about other matters also – about Ethel Harrison for one and to explain to you (one of the stupidest of men where women are concerned!) why her attitude is <u>what</u> it is – That I don’t feel I can do on paper – But you are <u>not</u> coming and I must put up with it only you really <u>can’t</u> expect me</p>
