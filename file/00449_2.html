<p>It has been utterly impossible for me to secure a sitting room here, so we will have to eat in the very badly managed restaurant.</p>
<p>Just received your two letters of Friday and Saturday.</p>
<p>In conjunction with all the other horrible tales I have heard, it makes me fear to go away from here at all – I have already taken accomodation [sic] for Paris on the 4th and am hoping and praying to sail on the Adriatic on the 12th May –</p>
<p>All this we can talk over</p>
<p>[p. 4]</p>
<p>when I see you – I am sure you are aching to go sleepsy – bye now –</p>
<p>My room is <u>no. 3</u> – <u>piano primo</u> </p>
<p>I daresay they will not think it proper if I ask you up – as it is almost entirely occupied by a huge bed –</p>
<p>It <u>is</u> fine to know that you will be here soon –</p>
<p>Belle</p>
