<p>Detroit, <u>Mich.</u></p>
<p>Well B.B. darling, I am sure you will be surprised this time for here I am at Freers – He insisted upon my going back with him yesterday (he had been in New York for a week) to spend a few days and although I had a thousand engagements, business and otherwise, I just threw them all over and away we went on the 5 o’clock train – I had a drawing room and so did Freer – and we had a perfectly A.1 dinner in his room; I have never known him to be in such a jolly, vivacious and lovable mood, he told me stories of his experiences in China, Japan & India which so fascinated me that I was horrified when I looked at the time and found it was after eleven – I was conscience-stricken as I know he had been in New York to see his Doctor and was not supposed to use his voice – I had <u>such</u> a wretched night, as I cannot sleep on those beastly trains and I lay awake most of the night praying for daylight – When it finally came, it showed me a well-nigh unimaginable wintry scene – blustering snow falling and almost a foot high on the ground – We had breakfast at Freer’s house (I am staying in his house – he said he remembered perfectly my remarks about the Hotel and would not let me go there) and then we started in to look at the treasures which had been received since you and I were there – Oh! dear, the man has just come to announce dinner – I’ll <s>finish</s> write more before I go to bed –</p>
<p>I love you <u>Belle</u></p>
