<p>a delightful person. Please tell Mary that I will do anything I can for him, but he appears to have letters to everyone here – I feel that I must <u>fly</u> to Damascus at once. I have never seen anything which actually <u>thrilled</u> me more than these mosaics. Of course the moment they began to appear on the screen, I thought of the early MSS. B.N.139– Joshuaralletc etc. etc. and was glad he also linked them up –</p>
<p>By the way, I am sending you a copy of Omont’s new edition of ‘les plusanciensMSS.grec’as I promised long ago.</p>
<p>They only reached us this week and I was <u>enraged</u> with thatcrookChampion and wrote him so – as he quite obviously delayed the copies due us (for making the publication possible)</p>
