<p>similar – Tomorrow I am going to play with Pollard & Sydney Colvin at the B.M. & lunch with Sydney Cockerell who is coming up for that purpose. As I was expecting to leave at 2 we are lunching at the ungodly hour of <u>12</u> – I don’t mind as I shall have two hours to spend at the National Gallery – In the afternoon I am going to take Ethel H. – to see the things at Princes Gate – & as so far <u>no one</u> has asked me to dinner I shall</p>

<p>probably remain quietly at home & rest up for my journey on Thursday – My Doctor dismissed me with his blessing today so that I shall probably not see him again as he thinks I am leaving tomorrow. I have known him so intimately in this short time & learned to like him <u>so</u> much that I really shall miss him & regret not seeing him for some little time. Well dear it is long past midnight & I am a bit fogged so I will stop & run to bed – You were a “m<u>eany</u>” not to write me a letter yesterday. I’ll pay you back by not writing again unless I have a big fat one in the incoming mail – Belle</p>
