<p>He is a big strapping six footer with a temperament that makes one gasp occasionally – and a sickly neurotic sort of wife who is absorbed in him & devoted to him and <u>inordinately</u> jealous. Fortunately she did not arrive on the scene until tonight so that I had time to grow a bit tired of him – He has just bought a new Locomobile which is a <u>bird.</u> He took me for a short ride in her to Roslyn & back in about ten <s>miles</s> minutes, an average of 72 miles an hour. It was almost the <u>most</u> exciting thing I have ever experienced – I never knew before that that car was so exceptionally fine – it is certainly the smoothest runner I have ever been in – Mrs. Leeds is a rather useless sort of person whose great attraction is her wealth & her capacity for making one terrifically comfortable & knowing all the men one likes & preferring them to women –</p>
