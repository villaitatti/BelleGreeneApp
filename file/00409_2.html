<p>second – I shall sail for London either on the 21 or28of this month to look over some collections for Mr. Jack – Of course I would have wiggled out of it, had you been coming, but I may as well oblige him now as he has been so <u>fearfully</u> nice to me & is most anxious for me to go – I do not think I can find an excuse for getting to you in Florence as the business could not possibly occupy me more than 2 weeks – I <u>may</u> be able to get to Paris for a week or 5 days – Is there any chance of your getting up there? I almost hesitate to ask – because it seems so selfish of me – I don’t want to prolong this trip because it might interfere with my making a longer trip late next summer or early fall – dependant of course upon your movements – That is, if you could come over here & spend a month or so with me in</p>
