<p>although suffering from a dreadful cold and hunted up Blakeslee – He was <u>so</u> very much disappointed when he found that he could in no way get the picture for you – He is <u>quite</u> devoted to you as I think you will learn in the future Your letters have delighted me and I am so happy to have you with your friends who love you so much</p>
<p>althoughI suppose that by this time you are backat Florence– I had a most adorable letter from Mary – really she is a <u>dear</u> – I shall try to answer it today but I have ten million letters to get off by tomorrow’s post & am not sure I shall be able to do them <u>all</u> .</p>
<p>had a cable from J. P. from Cairo – He is going to Palermo & then to Rome – get’s [sic] there about the middle of March –</p>
<p>How I should love to be</p>
