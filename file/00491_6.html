<p>you – of June 10 & 12</p>
<p><u>June 10</u> – why are you “off” Cicognara as the painter of our Tarocchi? </p>
<p>Many thanks for your opinion of the Jerome MS. paintings – I <u>quite</u> agree with all you say – I <u>know</u> the script is Bolognese – and it is more than likely that the illum. are – In regard to the notes on the back, I could have put them <s>all</s> on<s>e</s> [^ all the photos^] had I thought you wanted them – The text “gives them away” – <u>not</u> my learning – </p>
