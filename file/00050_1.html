<p>My dear my dear –</p>
<p>What a distance you are from me! When I allow myself to stop and think of it, it quite unnerves me –</p>
<p>Thank you so much for the enchanting book of the Italian Renaissance men – I love it for its own sake and especially because it came from you – I had a wonderful Christmas & hope you did too; but you should have been here with me – your own true love –</p>
