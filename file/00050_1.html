<p>My <u>dear</u> my dear –</p>
<p>What a distance you are from me! When I allow myself to stop and think of it, it quite unnerves me –</p>
<p>Thank you <u>so</u> much for the enchanting book of the Italian Renaissance men – I love it for its own sake and especially because it came from you – I had a wonderful Christmas & hope you did too; but you <u>should</u> have been <u>here</u> with <u>me</u> – your own true love –</p>
