<p>Friday Evening Nov. 12</p>
<p>Sweet heart –</p>
<p>I received yours of the 1st from Florence several days ago & wish I could remember what I said in mine of the 15th that made you unhappy – In any case, whatever it was I wish I had not said it, for are we not unhappy enough</p>
<p>to be such millions of miles apart without adding thereto unwittingly</p>
<p>I have never been so physically tired in my whole life as I am tonight & am writing this in bed, on one elbow – The week has been unusually busy – The New Theatre opened Saturday afternoon and there was a rehearsal</p>
