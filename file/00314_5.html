<p><u>Wednesday, April</u> 29</p>
<p>Nothing of interest today darling. I lunched with a pack of “Feminists” at the Colony Club and sat dumb most of the time – talked “art” when I was supposed to – and left a quieter & sadder female –</p>
<p>Tuesday <u>April</u> 30</p>
<p><u>What</u> do you think dearest? I went to bed and to <u>sleep</u> at ten o’clock last night consequently feel utterly worn out this morning. Had dinner in the grill of the Biltmore with Arnold Genthe</p>

<p>who spoiled it all by insisting upon my going to inspect Mrs. Guinness’ portrait of him before – he said she had begged him to have me look at it – If he tells her what I said about it, she’ll never want me to look at another effort of hers – It’s the dirtiest mess I ever saw –</p>
<p>In the foreign mail yesterday, I received the two Foucher books on Buddhist iconography. They look formidable but I guarantee to read em – [<i>double underlined</i>: with joy]! Thank you <u>so</u> much dearest – I have written to the British Museum to send you the Ku Kai Chi [sic] reproduction</p>
