<p>artist Rothenstein a day or two after he landed here at a dinner, & have seen him several times since. He is doing a pastel of my head – I have not seen it yet</p>
<p>but hope it will be worth preserving – He is a <u>most</u> interesting chap and I liked him immensely Why didn’t you give him a letter to <u>me</u> instead of to all the fools of the world – To put that real man up</p>
