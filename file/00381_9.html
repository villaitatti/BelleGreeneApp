<p>I hear from you, that Sully would not, nay <u>could</u> not pay our price. You see he knows what they cost – and I suppose he thinks that at the very least, we would <s>a</s> ask say 600-$650,000 – whereas today, Frick is willing to pay $1,000,000 – but that I would not take from him or any <u>other private</u> collector</p>
<p>As to Duveen – we have had a rather lively time over the porcelains – They announced (as you have probably read ere this) that they paid 4 millions for the collection</p>
