<p>mephistophelean seeming creature whom I met in New York last year. He is the editor of the Sphere and is very gossipy about everything & everybody</p>
<p>He gave me a very flattering send off in the Sphere – but I think he could be <u>very</u> catty if so inclined and with such a large public, I do <u>not</u> wish him ever to be catty to me, so I'm just deliberately going to try to tie him up personally in me charms (!!??) He's the type I can <u>always</u> succeed with – that <u>any</u> designing female critter under 40 could succeed with & of course I would not bother except for his old paper which I see in everyone one's house. Its <u>not</u> nice to be designing but "self preservation" etc. etc. Then I'm going to dine with Thomas B. Wise in the evening at Hampstead.</p>
<p>I dare say you would not know of him, but he, with [^late^] Buxton Forman were the great authorities on & collection of Keats, Shelley, Swinburne & all that crowd – I have not met him before but have corresponded with</p>
