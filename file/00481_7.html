<p>love him – His wife, for instance still adores the ground he walk on&Juliet Hamilton and I never tire of talking of him when we are together – He is a born recluse and only comes out of his shell to his few intimates – all Italian art (except early engravings) is new to him and I scolded him roundly when he told me that he had nearly bought a Francia – I suggested that he limit himself to old furniture etc etc until he knew more about pictures. He humbly confessed to having bought two decorative 16-17 cent pieces</p>
