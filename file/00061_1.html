<p>Monday – Mars 28</p>
<p>Well I had to bring your letter to town with me to finish it and lo! a truly delicious letter from you on my desk – and right on top of an enormous pile – needless to say the others waited while I read yours <u>twice</u> </p>
<p>I hope your daughter-in-law (I’m <u>so</u> glad its “in-law”!) will look me up & I do hope she will come at a time when I shall be comparatively free</p>
<p>[p. 2]</p>
<p>because, as most of my friends are going away so soon I am obliged to concede <s>to</s> them all the hours they demand – and they are twice as many as are given to the day – I lunched today with Forbes Robertson, I have had a frenzied case on him ever since he has been here & have seen quite a little of him – but alas he is unalterably devoted to Gertrude & talks of little else – I do think he has the <u>most</u> enchanting voice of any one I know & I love to hear him talk, if only to ask</p>
