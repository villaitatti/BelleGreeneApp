<p>Thusdo we find those who lay in wait to slay us. I am retrieving the Freer letter herewith. Of course he <u>is</u> a nice old Moth-eaten dear, but certainly, au fond, of Detroit. Did you ever read such stilted phrases. I have today received the Hsia-Kuei photograph from Fairbanks of the Boston Museum. He’s an old goat too, but a kindly one – The trees are quite <u>too</u> wonderful, in fact <u>I</u> never saw such trees in life of painting</p>
