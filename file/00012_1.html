<p>Tuxedo – Easter Sunday</p>
<p>Sir – I embrace you! –</p>
<p>This is a most glorious Easter day – radiant with sunshine and the world – like myself is bubbling over with joy – This is one of the days which proves that I am a pagan</p>

<p>We had a most glorious horseback ride this afternoon – were out for over two hours – and if you have ever been here you know what a glorious country it is for riding –</p>
<p>Last night we had a real old fashioned barn –</p>
