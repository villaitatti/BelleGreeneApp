<p>I have had too a great many financial worries and troubles but there is no point in bothering you about them – I hope you bought the Chile Copper bonds when I told you of them as they have gone up over 15 points and I believe are good for double that amount – I have bought some of this new Midvale steel stock (of which Carey is the head) and hope to make some money out of it – It has already advanced 25 points since</p>
<p>I bought it and if it will keep on I will just about double the money Mr. Morgan left me – On the other hand I have some stocks that are falling 5 and 10 points a day and unless they recover (which I doubt) I shall lose about $15,000 – Our stock market has been just about as mad as the whole war situation I have a friend who has made over a million dollars in Bethlehem Steel and another who has lost half that amount in</p>
