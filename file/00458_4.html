<p>death – I did not want to approach the large firms (Lane – Putnam – Scribner etc.) until you tell me that it is o.k. to do so – Also let me know if you have any preference among them. Sherman is <u>of course</u> a cussed creative & antagonistic to almost everyone – Certainly his A. in A. is the best thing <u>here</u> & if he is shoved out it will be mainly the Duveen ring because of his unwillingness to either sue himself or to allow himself to be used as a dupe – I really believe his attitude is more <u>cussedness</u> & a sense of his own importance, than unbending honesty – I long ago admonished him about writing of his own trash – but he did it (I think) with the usual point in view – i.e. enhancing their commercial value & in that he has greatly succeeded – <u>also</u> to bring himself to notice as being a collector –</p>
<p>ps – I read the Four Black Penny's</p>
