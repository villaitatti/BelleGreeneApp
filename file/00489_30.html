<p>I will <u>never</u> be admitted!</p>
<p>Tomorrow I go back to the Library, to sit on the job, for weeks on end – and do not expect to go away again [^except^] for week ends, until I go out to Montana and Arizona – the second week of July – I expect to be everlastingly <u>damned</u> after that trip –</p>
<p>[in secretarial script: <u>Nota bene</u> ] 14 – rather <u>28</u> pages – This ought to last you for at least 2 weeks!</p>
<p>Yours for Joyousness –</p>
