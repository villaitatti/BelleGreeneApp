<p>for such a procedure – Read was knighted automatically by becoming President of the Sociy of Antiquaries. I got awfully tired of Read’s letters, much as I like him and have not written to him now for over ten days. He had planned to spend September and October in France, but I daresay <u>that</u>is all off now. No more for now – as I must, perforce keep this open until Thursday night – & things will probably come to a crisis before then – </p>

<p>Well, my Beloved – <u>so</u> many things have happened – I have received two letters from you <u>and</u> England has finally declared war – You note the relative importance to <u>me</u> of these two events! <u>How</u> thoroughly I enjoyed your letters. I only wish you had told me <u>more</u> of George Chase – Is he as he says, so fascinating personally that these women come from near & far to have children  by him?</p>
