<p>[p. 12]</p>
<p>with Kennerley, I found two telephones from her – probably to tell me about her visit there. </p>
<p>I am going to tea with Henry Golden Dearth, who is going to show me his Persian leaves. </p>
<p>Worch feels that Freer will <u>surely</u> not buy that Chinese group we saw; and he also says the price is enormous. He is going to telephone me as soon as the pieces come back, so I will let you know what Freer takes.</p>
<p>Forbes (of the Fogg Museum) came in this afternoon. He is going abroad at the end of April. <u>He</u> says that Denman Ross is very anxious to meet me [^(!!!!)^] & he has arranged to have us both at his house for tea (in Cambridge) on Friday afternoon at four o’clock – I will write you my impressions of the good man – </p>
<p>Good bye dear for this mailing </p>
<p>I am so happy and complete in your love and in my loving you. We are together “for always” now. All my tenderest love to you –</p>
<p>Your Belle</p>
