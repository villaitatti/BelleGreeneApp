<p>Small badly worn fragment. I pity the person who gets it at that price – The house & its contents, which are being sold today & tomorrow are shocking. I lunched today with Mrs. Lloyd Griscom who is very anxious for me to go abroad with her in June as her husband cannot go. They are becoming very important people here. Do you know them at all? I like them both immensely –</p>

<p>If you do not hear from me very often within the next two weeks, it will be because I am jumping around a good deal, from place to place – I am going to Philadelphia tomorrow to stay two days and early next week I am off to Washington for the home [?] time – I send you more love than you can <u>possibly</u> imagine</p>
<p>Yours as Ever</p>
<p>Belle.</p>
