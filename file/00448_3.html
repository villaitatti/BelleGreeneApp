<p>or in Siena or in Montecassino [sic] & of course I want very much to be at least for two days at I Tatti. but as far as visiting alone is concerned We can do that in New York next winter in my hideous little house (it is too <u>damnably</u> ugly!)</p>
<p>Please therefore make all <u>your</u> engagements. I will manage mine to fit in – because after</p>
<p>all, I am sure it makes very little difference at what <u>hour</u> I am at the Vatican – What I should <u>like</u> to do is to keep as many of the <u>afternoons</u> as possible for us to go about – I cannot hope to keep them all – but I will <u>certainly</u> fit in my time to yours – It will be much easier that way – so do you bring <u>me</u> a list of <u>your</u> engagements –</p>
<p>My love to Mary</p>
<p>Ever Yours</p>
<p> <u>Belle</u> </p>
