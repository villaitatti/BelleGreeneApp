<p>longer remain those of August & September. Also I shall <u>never</u> forget my wonderful month with you in Italy. It combined so many wonderful things, our <u>real</u> love, the wonderful things we saw, the enchanting motor trips & all that you taught me & did for me – I can never, nor wish ever to forget & I shall always hold it in my memory</p>
<p>as something <u>very</u> precious. As Mary held her box of ointment – (that’s [ <i>double underlined</i> : pretty] bad – but we’ll let it go!) I am very very busy today – I am going to close up the deal for the Rembrandt etching with Obach – make as good a deal as I can withQuaritchfor my duplicate, see Murray & leave him gracefullypoisinghimself in a financial mid-air until I consult with J. P. – buy a few clothes</p>
