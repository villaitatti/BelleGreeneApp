<p>you are going to get away for a rest – it will be <u>splendid</u> for you – I am very busy in the library tieing [sic] up all the loose ends which J.P. left after his departure. I had an adorable cable & 2 wirelesses from him – He is a lamb but an ungodly liar – Thanks for your offer to send me some stuffs – I don’t believe I can use any just at present – I have some beautiful pieces of old brocade, two very stunning capes & some heavenly Genoese velvet which have been give me from time to time and I think they will be all I shall have room for – As to furniture the rooms are <u>so</u> tiny that I have been unable to use old pieces & have had to have some made to fit the rooms – I am <u>sure</u></p>
