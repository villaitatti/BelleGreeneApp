<p> <s>yet</s> years ago – think of poor Mrs. Barton French & Mrs. Bordy Harriman – and all the rest – He is a really delightful person and I can well understand a young girl being fascinated by him – I am now counting the <u>moments</u> until you come. What time do you reach N. Y. on Saturday? The roads are <u>so</u> bad that I fear we will not be able to motor into the country at all, while you are here. I am going out to investigate this afternoon and will report tomorrow. You are a great big darling to give me So much of your time the last week of your stay. I love you for it heaps & heaps & heaps. I warn you however to steer clear of “philosophizing” – You know how it makes one lose sight of the realities of life – more tomorrow Your Belle</p>
