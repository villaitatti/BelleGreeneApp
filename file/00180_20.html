<p>penny I can put my hands on – so that all the people who are waiting to see me collapse after J. P.’s demise will get jolly well left – (There is a man sitting beside me as I write – because I had to bring this letter home</p>
<p>to finish it – who is <u>almost</u> driving me insane – trying to read the letter & <u>furious</u> that there exists a man to whom I can write at such length</p>
<p>He’s a jealous hound) – There –he read that so has stopped –</p>
