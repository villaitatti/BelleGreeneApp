<p>Tuesday, <u>April 1</u> </p>
<p>Dear B.B.</p>
<p>This must be a scrawly pencil affair as I have been laid up here all day with a threat of the "flu" – You can <u>imagine</u> my rage at having all my plans & engagements upset this way – I hope to be sufficiently well by tomorrow noon to get off of to the Bensons until next Tuesday, where thank God, Mrs. B. will take care of me – I sent word that I thought I ought not to come, but she insisted that I could be twice as well taken care up there as here – That of course</p>
<p>is perfectly true but it does seem pretty bad to foist an invalid on her when she has a houseful of guests – I really do love her – <u>Mrs</u> Morgan prefers him, but I think that may be because Mrs. B. rather puts it over a bit on Mrs. M. –</p>
<p>I <u>am</u> so damned sick of this sneezing & wheezing – I caught the germs while in Cambridge on Monday & Tuesday – The damned inn was so damp and I foolishly and out of sheer personal vanity did not wear my woolies – Always a foolish omission in England I find –</p>
<p>I did have a splendid time there – Dear old Sydney Cockerell just shut up shop</p>
