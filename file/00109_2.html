<p>for do you remember dear how well you were and how well you <u>looked</u> when we were together. But daarrling dear [<i>triple underlined</i>: don’t] let Ethel H. worry you in the least I am <u>quite</u> wise to that little viper & when I am once <u>wise</u> there is no cause for worry – As you know I <u>must</u> be nice to her but once she has left</p>
