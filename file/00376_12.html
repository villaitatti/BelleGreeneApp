<p>a topic I’m heartily sick –</p>
<p> <s>At</s> [illegible deletion] <s>In my</s> </p>
<p>During my sleepless nights, I have been reading (for the first time!) the English Miracle Plays, the York & Chester series and I’m <u>madly</u> in love with them. I almost died of laughter after Noah’s <s>Ark</s> [inserted: Flood] and cried like an idiot [inserted: over] the Sacrifice of Isaac – do you remember when he is getting ready to execute him, when he says “Make thee readye, my deere darlinge For we must doe a littill thinge” and later on,</p>
<p>“Nowe, my deere sonne, here shalt thou lye</p>
<p>Unto my worke nowe I muste hie</p>
<p>I hade as leeve my selfe to die</p>
<p>as thou, my darlinge deare” –</p>
<p>I <u>love</u> it and have read and reread it so much that I know it almost entirely by heart – and I really think it is one of the most sincere, most heart-breaking</p>
