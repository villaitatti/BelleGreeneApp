<p>crazy about them andbegme for them – but if <u>you</u> don’t like them neither do I any longer – of course they are <u>very</u> posey & all that – but they made me so <u>very</u> much better looking than I am. that I could not help having a sneaking fondness for them. I had a cable from J. P. on the 19th saying he was in Rome and enjoying his first day <u>immensely</u> Isn’t he a wonder and a dear? I wish you two were one person & then</p>
