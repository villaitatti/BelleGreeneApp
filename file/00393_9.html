<p>I received a letter from Loo and am going up to see his things in a day or two but I shall not be able to buy anything of any large value until my stocks straighten out – I had a letter from Rosenberg saying he had sold his two Guan yin statues to a dealer so I shall not be much surprised if I see them at Loo's – Bahr has brought over a lot of Chinese paintings</p>
<p>most of which he is going to sell at auction I never liked any of his stuff and so shall not be interested in his sale – there is a dealer here namedTonyingwho has the finest Sung bowl I ever hope to see. I am crazy to buy it but his price is prohibitive. He first asked me $12,000 – and is now asking $8,000 – but that is just $7,000 beyond what I could pay for it – He also has a much repaired Lo-Han and some very phoney looking Chan bronzes –</p>
