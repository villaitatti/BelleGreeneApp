<p>Honestly I was almost in a state of coma <s>when</s> by the time the men came in – and so were the other women, except E. Cutting who <u>adores</u> a name.</p>
<p>Have met numerous "furriners" at various dinners etc. (I am not ashamed of this nonsensical gadding – it is purposely done) The one I liked best is Lord Richard Nevill – Have you run across him? He is now aide or Comptroller of the Household (I don't know which) to the D. of Devonshire in Canada.</p>
<p>A perfectly delightful, quietly witty, all observant creature – I took him to Helen Frick's – and to the Morgan Wing of the Museum.</p>
