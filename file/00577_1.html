<p>24 September, 1934. </p>
<p>Dear B.B., </p>
<p>I am now back on the job, and find – as usual – that I did not send you either of the letters written in Europe. Although they do not amount to anything, I enclose them just to let you know that I really did write. </p>
<p>We are planning to have a rather busy year here, with some lectures by Morey and Panofsky on Illuminated Manuscripts, including iconography of the same, and I am busy wondering (if not more) whether I can do anything about getting the Warburg Library over here. I cannot think of anything which would please me, and everyone else, more than to hear that you were coming over to pay us a visit. You must hurry up and do so before I pass out of old age. </p>
