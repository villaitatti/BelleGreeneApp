<p>my dear friends – who doesn’t know a picture from an ash can [^(preferring the ash can)^] is descending upon Florencewith Suarez, to buy some Eyetallian furniture for her house. I’m giving her a letter to you, and imploring her <u>not</u> to use it, as I’m at a double-loss to know what you can <u>possibly</u> see in each other. She’s one of the best partygivers in N.Y – all the millions (both of her own & her husbands) there are – and a good scent<i> – </i>As soon </p>
<p>[p.5]</p>
<p>as people heard she was going to Florence they mentioned your name & she ‘wants to know’ about this arty guy – Her name is Betty Shonnard?<i> & </i>she’s going onto yachet [sic] around Greece, so you may meet there also & then shoot in Scotland, where you assuredly <u>won’t meet</u></p>
<p>Do you think it would be all right for me to takeBobbie (Oct. 7) to Venice with me in August? Or do children get fever<i> &</i> all such things there then? <u>Do</u> find out and tell me – butI forgot, you’re not interested in children. </p>
