<p>of Antony & Cleopatra in the Evening – a most gloomy affair – Marlowe was disgraceful & Sotheran [sic] not much better. The theatre itself is beautiful but the acoustics exceedingly bad – I had to go on Monday night again for the opening – Tuesday I went over to Boston for the opening of their new opera house &</p>
<p>Wednesday to the Philharmonic</p>
<p>Thursday the New Theatre again for a new play by Eddy Knoblauch – a miserable tiresome thing and tonight I have just returned from dinner with the Gilders – besides my days have been distracting almost maddening – Langton Douglas is over here & has paid us two visits. He is a slimy fat podgy & seemingly guileless person whom I loathe & treat accordingly.</p>
