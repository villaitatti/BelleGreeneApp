<p>a year or so and see what happens – aussi soit-il</p>
<p>You seem to be overrun by visitors. I am not at all envious of you – my one feeling now is to be “let alone” and not see any more people than I have to. It is <u>quite</u> impossible for me to get away this year – I may be able to arrange for Saturday & Sundays in the country – but I have too much on hand to look for more than that – I feel the responsibility, if anything more keenly now – I shall write you again this week – the men abroad have been <u>too</u> wonderful to me – I could embrace them all – Don’t worry or be puzzled about me – I’ll come out alright Ever your,</p>
<p>Belle</p>
