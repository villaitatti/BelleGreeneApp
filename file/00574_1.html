<p>20 February, 1934. </p>
<p>Dear B.B. </p>
<p>I know how outrageous it is for me not to have written you [<i>underlined in pen: </i><u>personally]</u> before this, and I have not time to do so even yet, but I am anxious to know as soon as possible how far you have progressed with your Catalogue of the Walters Collection of Paintings. I have, very stupidly, I suppose, agreed to go on their Board, and despite Mr. Walters millions of art objects, etc. which have to be ironed out, I feel that the proper cataloguing and arrangement of the collection of paintings ought to be our first task.</p>
<p>I told Mrs. Walters that I was in great hopes that your Catalogue was sufficiently far advanced for us to consider the publication of it. As you can understand, for personal reasons, as well as for those of an official on the job, I certainly should like to make your study the first publication from the Gallery. If, as I fear, deep down within me, you have not gone very far with this, and perhaps do not intend to go further, will you let me know to whom you would be willing to entrust this arduous task?</p>
<p><i>[handwritten in left margin, with bracket:</i><u>Confidential </u>? Any one to suggest?]</p>
<p>I am, confidentially, planning to use experts in the other fields of the collection; for example, Goldschmidt for the ivories (if I can get him, a good man for the Gothic sculptures, etc. and so on down the line. I find that some of the best things Mr. Walters ever purchased are still in cases and have never been shown.</p>
<p>I am planning a rather brief Catalogue of about 150 of our Illuminated Manuscripts which we have placed on exhibition at The New York Public Library here, and when it comes to the Italians I am quoting you rather freely. I hope you will not object!</p>
<p>My best remembrance to Nikky [sic], Mrs. Berenson, and yourself. [<i>handwritten in </i>([<i>underlined four times: </i>More] to YOU)</p>
<p>Belle] </p>
<p>Mr. Bernard Berenson, </p>
<p>I Tatti, </p>
