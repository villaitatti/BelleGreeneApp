<p>But I am sick & tired of these stupid fools over here who are able to impress themselves by <u>sheer force of</u> [ <i>triple underlined</i>  <i>:</i> dollars]– can you not imagine how unknown and unheeded they would be withoutthem?</p>
<p>Billy Ivins has gone to Leipsig [sic] to buy (or try to buy [ <i>in green pencil</i> : )] some prints) I aided & abetted (& really accomplished it through J. P. M.) it so he could have a holiday – but between you & me, I think that <u>almost</u> [ <i>double</i>  <i>underlined</i> :all]Prints are poor, second rate things, and I can imagine <u>nothing</u> more – [ <i>underlined in green pencil:</i> nullifying]– (the only word I can think of <s>i</s>  <s>t</s> at the moment that expresses it)</p>
