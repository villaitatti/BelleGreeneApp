<p>mentioned your name at luncheon the other day à propos of some picture to which she was giving a high sounding name – and she snorted so long and so loud, that I was obliged to say <u>emphatically</u> complimentary things about you – You can imagine how it annoyed me <u>so</u> to <u>have</u> to <u>do</u>??? –</p>
<p>I'm off now to another Rosita Forbes dinner – I like the young lady <u>immensely</u>, but am getting a bit fed up with constantly seeing her. The Dutch Treat Club gave us (me & her) a luncheon the other day and within 1 hour she had vamped every man (& there were fully 300) in the place – <u>I</u> did not exist!!!! except as an excellent foil for her – I daresay that is what life will spell for me from now on</p>
