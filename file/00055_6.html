<p>I am having my portrait painted in an old Spanish shawl that the Big Chief gave me – It is very tedious & tiresome work and I shall be glad when it is finished – but alas! I promised to sit for Laura Hills in Boston in April. She wants to make a miniature of me, seated on a leopard’s skin! Don’t you think that is a horrible idea? She insists that it will be the best thing she has done – My dear I have still millions of things to say to you but it is 7:30 & Mrs. Brown is giving me a large farewell dinner at 8 & I must get up & dress – Dear, this is <u>such</u> a nice big roomy sofa – why aren’t you here – and I have on a <s>tea</s> negligée that you would love. It was brought to me from Vienna & looks like a shower of falling rose leaves & is all covered with filmy lace and I know it would delight your fastidious eye. Don’t you [double underlined: dare] to tell me you love me – if you did you would come to me <u>at</u>  <u>this</u>  <u>minute</u> when I want you – So, oh <u>so</u> much I want you to take me in your arms on this sofa and hold me until the breath leaves my body – Belle.</p>
