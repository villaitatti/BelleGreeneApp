<p>it too adorable? I have also been reading Rabelais (in English) and the Apochrypha [sic] – Lordy how I have howled with laughter until I ached from it later – I think if I were to chose my six favorite books (and were <u>limited</u> to that number) I’d take Alice in Wonderland, The Bible, the Mille Nuits, Rabelais, The Apocrypha, the Miracle Plays, Casanova, – oh! dear I’m only just beginning and there’s 7 already except that the Apocrypha will go in with the Bible so my six indispensables are there anyhow – now what would <u>you</u> choose? Only <u>6</u> mind you – [<i>line inserted</i>]</p>
<p>There is the wildest possible rumour here that Edith Wharton is going to marry Henry James! Do tell me. but everyone is saying it with a huge question mark in their eyes – Perhaps it was started as a huge joke – I don’t think that the people who know them were very much surprised by the marriage of Mrs. Gaelet and Clevs – at least </p>
