<p>22 April, 1927</p>
<p>Dear B.B –</p>
<p>I am <u>thrilled</u> by just the appearance of your book, which reached me this week – and on Sunday, I am going to give <u>most</u> of the day to reading it –</p>
<p>Duveen has sent me some 10 copies (for which I shall of course pay him) to send to those dumb brutes the Trustees etc. of the Metropolitan Museum – as he says he “cannot very well” do so – Well I <u>will</u> – although I can’t believe there are enough brains <u>between</u> them all to understand and appreciate it – I will also send copies to Yale, Harvard & Princeton with a personal letter in each.</p>
<p>I have reached the point where I don’t care <u>one</u>  <u>single</u>  <u>damn</u> about that old Met. Mus. any more – I am infinitely more interested in the Fogg & some of the Western museums –</p>
<p>By the next mail I am sending</p>
