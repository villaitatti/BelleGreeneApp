<p>Dearestest – I was interrupted by lots of people while writing you yesterday. A Dr. & Mrs. Allen from Cleveland – She extremely wealthy and he fairly well off – who are collecting Chinese Porcelains – They wanted me to take them to Worch so I met them there shortly afterfive and he bought (to me) some hideous Ming porcelains – two monochromes and two hideous large vases with horrid relief decoration. Worch told me that he had given Agnes Meyer a large pair of glazed pottery heads which he showed me the day they arrived. I admired the sculptural quality of them immensely but hated the hard yellow glaze – She also bought a stone which when it arrived W. had told me was not worthy of my attention even. It was $1200 – I hope Mrs. Gardner will buy the beast – It is so very stunning. Agoness came in yesterday afternoon while I was writing you – I did not waste much time on her you can bet – she was very much worried I think over her</p>
