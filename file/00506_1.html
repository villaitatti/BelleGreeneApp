<p>[ <i>on the left margin, written parallel with the edge of the sheet</i> : Did you read Valentine's article on the 2 picta panels in Helen Frick's collection? Whoinhell is Witz – father, son and nephew –?]</p>
<p>Dear B.B.– Just received yours of March 24. I <u>did</u> send you a package of photographs, containing those of the "Pacino" manuscripts and such as we already had taken of our all-to[sic]-few byzantines. I have another set of the Pacino lot and will send that to you – and if that million dollars worth is also scrapped by Mussolini you'll just have to go without them. I do not see Dedaloor the Gazette des Beaux Arts any more so do send along the tirages à part. Speaking of mundane matters, <u>have</u> you read my three pet books. The Flower beneath the foot — Prancing Nigger and Jurgen (unexpurgated!)?? You <u>must</u> – at once – Heaven alone knows when I will get away – I'm breaking in 3 new assistants – not one of whom seems promising, and at the moment of writing am too discouraged about this blessed Library to write, speak or think of it. By the way do you remember the name of the firm in Germany which is getting out the new <u>complete</u> Casanova? Many years ago some rich gent put my name down for a copy – but alas! he, as well as his good deeds, has gone down the Long Trail – and [^as^] I don't want to lose out on that Casanova, I want to get in touch with the people who have it in hand – I'll send the photographs of the Greek, Armenian etc. mss. over to</p>
