<p>Dear I do so love to receiveany thingfrom you. I don’t care <u>what</u> it is although you always send me enchanting things which reminds me that I forget to tell you how much I enjoyed Lord Dunsany’s “Dreamer’s tales” I liked especially the Madness of Andelsprutz & Ebb & Flow – although I have not read them all yet.</p>
