<p>o’clock and if you should happen to cross Sunday a.m., you will find me here then.</p>
<p>My room is no. 214 – but I feel you will not (very naturally) come in which case I willwrite youon my return from the country Sunday night. I can’t stopto sendyou a “diary” letter now – I have a luncheon engagement at the Bath Club in half an hour & want this to reach you as soon as possible – B. B. dear, <u>don’t</u> be despondent about us – I am sureevery thingwill come out alright & we will probably be better friends than ever – especially as I am a much saner & wiser person than I ever was before – Does your nose still wrinkle?</p>
