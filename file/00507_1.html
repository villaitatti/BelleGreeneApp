<p>Dear B.B.–</p>
<p>Here is your "yellow peril"!</p>
<p>I have been so wickedly – shamelessly bad about correspondence for the last 5 months having neglected every correspondent I have in the world, due to a combination of hectic times at the Library – hectic times of my own – and a large amount of selfishness & self indulgence.</p>
<p>Also I am always overcome by the hopelessness of writing to people so far away – The letter is cold and dead and valueless by the time it reaches you and by the time a reply reaches me, I have almost forgotten what it's all about!</p>
<p>This week end, is the first one I have not spent with, or rather <u>on</u>, the Rich, but yesterday I came up here to be with Bobbie, in a tiny bungalow right on – almost in – the Sound, near Stamford, Conn, which I took for him for the summer. I am not going to see any of the few people whom I know hereabout as I want to sleep & lie on <s>the</s> my back in the hot sand, a stunt I have always loved, in spite </p>
