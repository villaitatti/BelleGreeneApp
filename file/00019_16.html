<p>happiness in the world seemed to be on the morning dazzle of exultant life. One was so glad of mere animal life, it was so inexpressibly beautiful. I felt that I should like to enter into all the life that glows and teems upon the Earth – to feel with it – hope with it sorrow with it and love it – walk hand in hand with it and know that “eternity is today”</p>
