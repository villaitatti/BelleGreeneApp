<p>telling me what a fine time they were having and how much they had seen of the Big Chief when they were in Paris –</p>
<p>I do not expect J. P. home now until August as he has again put off his sailing and is not coming on the Olympic the 12 as I had expected</p>
<p>I receivedthebookof theCesena library. It is <u>beautifully</u> gotten up & I am sure J. P. will be <u>very</u> much interested in it – also I have received theLaufer-Chinese Pottery, theVitry, Sculpture Française & l'architectureromaneen France – For all of which I thank you with a hug & millions of kisses.</p>
<p>I am so glad to have</p>

<p>theLaufer& the sculpture books look <u>tremendously</u> interesting. Daarrling, if I could be with you, <u>live</u> with you for even a year, I <u>know</u> I would amount to something, but it is so difficult away off here alone –</p>
<p>Yes, I fear I shall not be able to come over</p>
<p>until late October – to stay for the Huth sale –</p>
<p>What I would really like would be to come to you at I Tatti until time to go to London for the sale (probably November 4) I doubt if I can be away longer than 6 weeks including the 2 weeks of voyage</p>
<p>This promises to be an appallingly busy year for J. P. and I feel that</p>

<p>I must be here with him as much as possible – On Thursday of this week I am going to start on a trip out to Oklahoma!! –</p>
<p>Clifford Harmon (the aviator) is getting up the party and invited me – They are going primarily on business to inspect some large oil</p>
<p>lands they have there but are combining pleasure with it as the directors are taking their wives.</p>
<p>I don’t know just yet, the entire personnel of the party but it includes the Colgate Hoyts, Commodore Benedict (who is Harmon’s father-in-law) & theGerritt [sic]Smith’s, We have two private cars attached to the 20 Cent. which leaves Thursday at 6:30 & our first stop is</p>

<p>St. Louis – where we will watch the balloonracesin whichHarmonwill take part. I will try towrite youevery day of the trip. It is the first time I have been further west than Boston so I am looking forward to it with much interest. It ought to be a very jolly party too</p>
<p>I am sure you will be delighted to know that I am <u>firmly</u> seated upon the Water Wagon,where, Ihave solemnly promised to remain until Jan. 1, 1912. Also my cigarettes have been reduced to 10 per day – Life seems <u>hardly</u> worth living</p>
<p>I had a letter from</p>
<p>32044150448538_08</p>
<p>the Black Ethel in which she complained bitterly of my neglect & wanted to know what the trouble was & said she would rather have it out than be in this suspense –</p>
<p>I wrote back a soothing syrup letter & told her I loved her as I <u>always</u> had & always would but that I was a beastly</p>
<p>correspondent as <u>any one</u> could tell her – You will probably have seen her by this time – I will write you from the train daarrling – I am glad you are so well and so happy but <u>don’t</u> be so happy that you forget [ <i>double underlined</i> : me]</p>
<p>I love you dear – more than ever – soon I will be telling you in your ear. Ever <u>your</u>  <u>Belle</u> .</p>
