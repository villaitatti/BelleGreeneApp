<p>happened not to have a <u>penny</u> available when I wrote you otherwise I could have made a little money for both of us and you could have – paid me back the principal if you had been so spitefully inclined, but after all, what is money to a wealthy one like you? It was silly of me not to cable but I <u>honestly</u> , for the first time in my life did not think of it – as I wrote you I was a <u>wreck</u> when I left Boston my trip had been so hurried and so busy but I put through the work for J. P. alright and he was <u>really</u> delighted and said so many times then and since.</p>
