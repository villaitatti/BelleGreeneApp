<p>outburst of Huntington’s – <u>Do</u> explain it to me – I forgot to tell you that Murray said last night that he <u>hoped</u> a well-aimed French or English bullet had rid the world of Valentiner by this time. <u>That whenever he got a chance he emphasized</u> V’s <u>relation to Bode &</u> what a <u>laughing stock they were making of the Met. Mus</u> . He was really <u>quite</u> vindictive about Valentiner, so perhaps the latter has been making nasty remarks about him.</p>
<p>I ordered the paper from Tiffany to be sent to your care Baring Bros I had already ordered a bunch to be sent to Italy – but as it is a <u>special</u> make, it will take a few weeks to get it –</p>
<p>Murray is quite upset about the Solario that was sold to the Boston Museum through Guiffrey – He says it’s no good – Do you know it?</p>
<p>Now I will close for today – you <u>must</u> give me a holiday</p>
