<p>mutual friends – One of my latest lovers is going to motor down here on Saturday & we will motor your <s>se</s> sister back to Smith on Sunday or Monday – I wish she were going to stay longer – She reminds me so much of you that with very little use of my abundant imagination I am talking to & feeling your dear self – I am hoping to have a letter from you via the Mauretania today or tomorrow as in your last you promised to</p>
<p>write me from Rome where I was surely with you in spirit. I am not coming over this year although J. P. promised me I could go on his return – but I should rather wait awhile & stay longer when I get there.</p>
<p>Alice Ditson is sailing on the 18th & I will write you if she goes any where within reaching distance of you as I want you to see each other. She will give youheapsof my love for you although <u>she</u> has no idea what a heavy load of it she is carrying – She is going first</p>
