<p>few hours when we were separated – when you were downstairs after dinner talking to Perkins – Daarrling, don’t <u>ever</u> think your letters are to [sic] long and <u>please</u> don’t threaten to make them shorter – <u>please</u> don’t – for if you do, I shall think that you love me or think of me <u>less</u> & that I could not bear – I shall write to dear Mary later in the day – I <u>hate</u> to stop this</p>
<p>[p. 16]</p>
<p>but I must – Haven’t you any more photographs of yourself to send me & <u>daarrling couldn’t</u> you have a cabinet sized photo taken in <u>three</u> positions so I could put it on my dressing table? I will have <u>lovely</u> frames made for them. & please do it <u>soon dear</u> I am not going to have any pictures but <u>yours</u> in my (no <u>our</u>) bedroom –</p>
<p>Daarrling I love you – My hands caress you, my mouth clings to yours & my heart is in your dear hands – I <u>love</u> you Belle</p>
