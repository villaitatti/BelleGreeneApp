<p>How often I think of all our wonderful hours together – “oserments! o parfum oh!baisersinfinis”!I must think up a better scheme than Canada this summer – I cannot bear to be with <u>you</u> & not see</p>
<p>beautiful things –</p>
<p>We will think up some [ <i>double underlined</i> : grand] scheme – Goodbye dear Heart – I am so absolutely & thoroughly your own dear – yours to do as you think fit with – I love you with a love I have scarcely imagined possible & that you love me is the joy of my life – I will write again for the Lusitania</p>
<p>Your <u>own</u> Belle</p>
