<p>Tonight I dined with the Jack Morgans and was bored to extinction. I love him but she is quite “too much Boston” for me and her icy aura chills my very soul – All of the rest of the company were strangers to me and the conversation was “uplifting” you know the kind – principal topic the “theology of sleep” – I have not yet arrived – And so dear one – another day has gone and I am</p>
<p>one day nearer to you – and it is shockingly late – I don’t dare look at the clock – & I must hie me to bed – I am sending this letter to Paris although I fear you will have left there before it reaches you –</p>
<p>It is in the nature of things that you should become – sooner or later – disappointed in me – but oh [double underlined: please] do not let me be disappointed in you –</p>
<p>Belle.</p>
