<p>the <u>least</u> it’s mighty ungrateful of Rodin after Tommy Ryan has done so much for him over here – The papers here are all saying <u>vile</u> things about Tommy because he is trying to make Sheehan U.S. Senator from New York & the Democratic party has split over it & they are at this moment at a deadlock on the subject – Just the same – between you & me, J. \P. is moving Heaven & Earth in odd moments to put</p>
<p>him (Sheehan) in – He is obviously a man of “the” interests & will be useful to all our crowd – but as usual Ryan is getting <u>all</u> the vituperation – I must say he does not seem to mind – [illegible deletion]</p>
<p>To change the subject – I read [ <i>double underlined</i> : twice] what Elsie de Wolfe said to you – That’s all <u>very</u> wise & true – not for one moment do I wish you to mean a jot less to any of your friends or even acquaintances because of me – you must know <u>I</u> am the last one to wish that, on the contrary</p>
