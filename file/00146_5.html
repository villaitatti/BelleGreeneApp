<p>be sitting in a dusty stuffy auction room all this afternoon and evening – I have just received a list of the books the British Museum have selected from the Huth library and am glad they did not take several I want to buy –</p>
<p>All your friends</p>
<p>are sailing for Europe this week or the next so you will soon hear all the gossip over here – I had a divine cable from J. P. in answer to a birthday letter I wrote him. He really is a darling –</p>
<p>Ethel said she had a nice long letter from you giving her your itinery [sic] for the next</p>
