<p>We generally plough through a very solemn report, talking of ships, sails & sealing wax, cabbages & kings– every thing <u>except</u> William whose name we have never <u>once</u> mentioned. Isn’t it curious? It bores me to extinction and as far as I See cannot do any good & when I get to the place where I cannot stand it another <u>Second</u> , I’m going to tell her</p>

<p>how <s>exciting</s> funny William was when he made love to me & I reckon that will serve to cut our acquaintance short – She quite dotes on Roger Fry & thinks I would have made a perfect wife for him – Isn’t it funny? She is quite disconsolate since William’s death, goes nowhere & sees no-one and is aging daily and to think how little he was worth it!</p>
