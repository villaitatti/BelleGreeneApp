<p>from writing on Sundays – I am always week-ending then & one <u>cannot</u> write in other people’s houses –</p>
<p>From Murray’s reports of Duveen, you ought to be able to get some money from them. He examined my Spinello Aretino last night and considered it a “wonderfully fine example” –</p>
<p>I <u>wish</u> I could hug you – I wish I had you stretched out and comfy on my lounge – and I wish I were a pocket in your coat, or</p>
<p>[p. 23]</p>
<p>a hair on your head or <u>something</u> that you always carried around with you – In any case and in every case I <u>love</u> you and <u>only</u> you, and very <u>hecticly</u>! (some word!)</p>
<p>Always</p>
<p>Your </p>
<p>Belle</p>
