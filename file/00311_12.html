<p>from me – I <u>will</u> try to condense them hereafter and to write less “self-centredly” as Read says & tell you more <u>outside</u> news – Don’t think I have forgotten the catalogues. I have been waiting & waiting for the Bronze – but we are having trouble about it at the Customs House and have not yet received it, so I think I’ll just go ahead & ship the others – I am to see hundreds of people on business & otherwise at the Library today & am going to do the <u>craziest</u> thing imaginable tonight, dine with “Diamond Jim Brady” – I hope no one hears of it – I will write all about it tomorrow – I wish I were able to get over this year, but I am pretty sure now that it will be impossible – but I shall <u>surely</u> come next spring – <u>surely</u> –</p>
<p>With all my love</p>
<p>Ever Your <u>Belle</u> </p>
