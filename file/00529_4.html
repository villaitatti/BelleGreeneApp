<p>As you have already perceived from this, I’m in a ‘low down’ – sick of everything – work,  play, – love, – everything.</p>
<p>I want to crawl off in a cornerand <u>enjoy</u> my mange– The nearest I can get to accomplishing that is spending some 16 hours in bed –</p>
<p>Are the flowers lovely at I Tatti? – There’s nary a one in N.Y – except <u>for sale</u> like everything else –</p>
<p>Wellold Dear – myLUVto you and don’t forget me and don’t put on any more of themphulairswhen you write again – or I’ll come over there an’ baste thebuttocks on yer –</p>
