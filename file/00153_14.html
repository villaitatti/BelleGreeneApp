<p>to feel that you will be bored by my long letters. Please take [ <i>triple underlined</i> : great] care of your health & please love me [ <i>double underlined</i> : more] than ever. I <u>adore</u> you sweet Love – I think of you <u>constantly</u> . What do you think I did last night? Read <u>all</u> your January letters. They were wonderful –</p>
<p>[p. 28]</p>
<p>I wont reread the April ones because they are so scolding and I <u>hate</u> to have <u>you</u> scold me – you were <u>made</u> to <u>love</u> me as I was made to love <u>you</u> and [illegible deletion] believe me it will take <u>all</u> the time we have at our disposal for us to fulfil [sic] <u>that</u> destiny – I cling to your dear, dear mouth & I cover your face with kisses</p>
<p>Your Belle.</p>
