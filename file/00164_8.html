<p>as besidesbeing with you I feel that the country will be a revelation to me –J. P. bought a Peregino from Langton Douglas which he (Douglas) writes me is the finest in private hands, he wrote me a long letter expatiating on its beauties which I did not answer & the other day I received another imploring my opinion – I wrote him that it was pretty</p>
<p>Enough but that I was not at all crazy about it as I had seen so many finer when I was abroad – I think that will hold him off a while as far as <u>I</u> am concerned –</p>
<p>The Kann pictures have come over & they are <u>really</u> splendid especially the two Memlings – I wish one of J. P.’s purchases were of that quality. I wrote J. P. of your pleasure in your visit to him & how</p>
