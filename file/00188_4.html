<p>thrice blessed Siena? How I love every bit of that wonderful town and I am always finding something in my books which I did <u>not</u> see there – for don’t you remember how the Anniversary of the birth of the Virgin or something like that, hung like a pall over the place while we were there and public museums etc.</p>
