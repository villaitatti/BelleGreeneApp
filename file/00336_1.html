<p>Dear B.B. –</p>
<p>I am an awfully cross person today – also – a very tired one, as I had to spend most of Saturday evening & all day Sunday getting data for Mr. Jack about the Chinese porcelains – He was in by daybreak this morning, most of which we spent going over dear J. P.’s personal effects for the appraisal.</p>

<p>I tell you it was pretty heart rendingwork, curiously enough it did not affect Jack in the slightest – <u>He</u><s>simple</s> seemed only delighted to find so much jewelry – He said “you did not realize that [^you^]had over a million dollars worth of jewelry in your care, did you I said certainly, as I was the person who had put it away from time to time.</p>
<p>I had a long letter from Rey in which he scoffs at Murray and says that of course, it will be to Murray’s advantage</p>
