<p>Although I had promised to take him back in my car, I was so nervous at the end of the talk and so afraid he would question me about it that I just beat it out – when I got home I wrote him a short note telling him I had to leave early because of a headache  but that I had enjoyed sitting at his feet – on my way home I stopped and picked up Kennerley and we went to the Metropolitan Club & had tea</p>
<p>He told me that Post had called on him in the morning and begged him, in the name of Mrs. Gardner, to publish a fantastic bit of Chinese folk-lore, written by the late Okakura – I do not know whether Mrs. Gardner suggested Kennerley or Post, but Kennerley was to write to her about it – Needless to say, being a small & petty person, I <u>canned</u> the stuff at once and after a decent interval it will go back to the Lady – I’d hate to have her see Kennerly as I dare say she would fall flat & it would put all the other little boys out of the running – Had a German lesson tonight & now to bed – I hope I have a letter tomorrow – Belle</p>
