<p>address in Venice is The Grand Hotel</p>
<p>Tuesday night – 3 August</p>
<p>Dear B.B.</p>
<p>Just a line of thanks for your letter which greeted me on my arrival yesterday – We were delayed 5 hours by the presence of Nobile on board</p>
<p>It was really funny to watch them slow down the boat so that none of the effect would be lost – I, of course, was <u>entirely</u> wrapped up in my Cardinal who stayed the night here (alas! not with <u>me</u> !) and left for</p>
<p>[p. 2]</p>
<p>Rome this morning.</p>
<p>As I wired you, I would love to explore some new country with you & Nicky – I should have been overjoyed to be with you alone – you know I have never event [sic] been <u>introduced</u> to the ordinary proprieties – but for your own sake & your physical, mental & domestic comfort & ‘atmosphere’, I think you would be happier before, during & after, if she would consent to come –</p>
<p>Poor kid, I dare say she</p>
