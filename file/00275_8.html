<p><u>Saturday morning </u></p>
<p>Darling –</p>
<p>I have just received yours enclosing the Freer letter. It is quite <u>stunning</u> and I am sending it to Eugene Meyer for his approval & will tell you what he says tonight – I am shockingly busy this morning as Thursty is laid up with a cold & I have to see every one – So no more dear love until after seeing you tonight – I have filled every minute of the time so as to make it “hurry up” <u>But</u> – I shall go home at six and rest a bit – I feel like Alice’s Rabbit – my heart & my body is “beating” and “bleating” All Yours</p>
<p>					Belle</p>
