<p>Friday 6:00 p.m. –</p>
<p>Daarrling – I received the itinery [sic] today by the Lusitania – I only had a moment in which to look at the first sheet & the last & it <u>almost</u> broke my heart – really upset me for the day – I don’t seem to find a moment in which to write you – I’m completely worn</p>
<p>out & <u>look</u> like the wrath of God – horrid black circles under my eyes – I am so tired – Ethel Harrison is a human <u>leech</u> she won’t let me alone a minute – will make <u>no</u> engagements with <u>anyone</u> except me – as J. P. is still here I can’t give her any time outside in the daytime so she spends all her time sitting beside</p>
