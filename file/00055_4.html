<p>is by sending you my diary & that I have sworn no one shall ever see</p>
<p>for this reason I wrote things in it I hardly dare think & it is a <u>great</u> comfort – There are a <u>great</u>  <u>many</u> things I could tell you about Lady Johnstone of whom you inquired in your last – I am pretty sure that her ideas in matters of art are not taken too seriously although I understand she has a really fine knowledge of Chinese porcelains – I do not know her personally at all, just met her once in the Library but thought her <u>extremely</u> attractive. The Big Chief thinks the same – I wish it was your <u>ear</u> I had here instead of this paper for I could tell you many things apropos which would amuse & highly entertain you – Needless to say [^ she sees that^] her attractiveness is <s>well</s> [^properly^] rewarded – but I [^do not blame her and^] <u>really</u> prefer her to most of the others, besides she is neither <u>fat</u> (which I loathe) nor a fossil –</p>
