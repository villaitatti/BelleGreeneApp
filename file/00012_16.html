<p>My dear, they have come to announce dinner and I have not [double underlined: begun] to dress!! – I had kept no track of the time but as my dear Browning says “there is no clock for feeling, for joy, for love” – I would that I could spread abroad my arms and gather you to me</p>
<p>Beloved – I want more ideas of soul life – I am certain there are more and you can give them to me – I kiss your eyes – Belle</p>
