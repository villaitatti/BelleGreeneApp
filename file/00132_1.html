<p>Daarrling –</p>
<p>I have today received <u>three</u> letters from you after having waited almost <u>ten</u> days for one – They are dated the 29 of Jan., Feb. 4 and Feb. 1 containing all that most interesting information about our doors & the photographs</p>
<p>of the Pisa & Florence doors – I am <u>quite</u> convinced by what you say that our doors are recent forgeries – I am <u>so</u> much obliged for the <u>way</u> in which you told me – I followed it perfectly & was tremendously interested in your <u>method</u> and then youstatedit all so clearly & concisely that I was not puzzled</p>
