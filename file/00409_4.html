<p>over – Glaenzer came over especially last week – to lay the matter before me – we have had one or two conferences, but of course I have not given him any encouragement. Seligmann’s idea is for me to come over and go through his stock & see what I could do with it – of course he did not know that I might go to London –</p>
<p>What do you think of it all? –</p>
<p>After all, one ought to begin to make some money for one’s old age & I’m pretty sure I could make all I would ever want in five years – with Seligmann or any one else – several of the dealers here, had asked me to go in business with them long ago – but I know what a nasty game it is & would rather get the “coin” in any other way were it possible Now I must come to the end of this. As you may not get it until the 15 or 16 of next month will you cable [ <i>triple underlined:</i> if] you want me to make any special plans – I’ll go to Claridge’s in London – All my love to you dearest – Your Belle</p>
