<p>tones in our panel. I have been hoping you would send me the photograph of the Piero della Francesca which I understand the Duveens are to get – I had hoped it would be a portrait but in any case you know how much interested in it I will be – I do hope you are planning to come over in the early winter – I am moving into my new little house on October 1 and hope to have it all ship-shape by the 15th, I cannot do as much to it as I hoped as I am not “in funds” at present but in the course of a year I may be able to make it presentable. It is awfully tiny and of course not at all swell except that the neighborhood is still Murray Hill but I shall be <u>much</u> more quiet and independent (except in regard to <u>our</u> deary evenings) than before – In any case you know how devoted my mother is to you and how she will want you to spend</p>
