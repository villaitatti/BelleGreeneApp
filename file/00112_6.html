<p>Mary is a <u>great</u> darling. I love her & should love to be with her a lot and such a <u>delicious</u> sense of humor – She wrote me a letter about her “suicide” club that made me <u>scream</u> with laughter. You & Scott really are two sillies – I could <u>shake</u> you when I was not kissing you (I daresay there would be little enough time for shaking!)</p>
<p>I am glad you enjoy your sister somuch I should <u>love</u> to meet her. . Do you think she will come over here soon, if so you must surely send her to stay with me for a little while at least – I’ll promise her there will be intervals in the day & night when I will not talk of you –</p>
