<p>my company for the future. Truly I <u>must</u> stop. It is two o’clock & Marie is <u>crazy</u> – wanting to pack the trunks etc. I amsorryI shall notfinda letter from you on the boat – Remember you are to write me <u>any thing</u> and <u>everything</u> you think or feel or want to “spit out of your mind”viayour pen & I shall do <u>almost</u> as much – not quite – for next time I want to be so sure that the certainty of triplets on the way will not please me in the slightest. I will write you from the boat & <u>if</u> I can get a note off at Cherbourg <u>will</u> do so –</p>
<p>Yours very truly sincerely & sorrowfully</p>
<p>Belle –</p>
