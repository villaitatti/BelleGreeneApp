<p>a subject I was stillsoreupon – and then without thinking, just because the idea amused me I told him of a “certain” man I know who insisted that I was my “Mammy-nurse’s”child – Well the things that boy said about <u>you</u> then dear B. B. I assure youwerenot fit to print! Nothing <u>I</u> could say infavourof your anonymous self – served in the slightest to stop the flow of his anger & he was still “hoping I didn’t allow myself to get mixed up with many men <u>of that sort</u> ” when we arrived – If he’d only known how <u>thoroughly</u> I had been “mixed up” –</p>
<p>The <u>awful</u> Williamsons tackled me in Waterloo Station and have been hanging on my neck ever since. They almost drive me frantic and there are so few people on board now that it is almost impossible to avoid them. He asked if he might sit at <u>my</u> table and I replied that I was sitting as always, with the Captain & he immediately insisted upon coming. What <u>can</u> one do with a creature like that?. I shall turn him over to Annie Morgan the first thing tomorrow morning and I feel sure her name</p>
