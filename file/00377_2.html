<p>to canvasas it blisters so badly and so continuously, but I have given orders to have it photographed <u>before</u> it is transferred; and of course will send you one at once – I am also having the Vivarini photographed – Do you want one of that? There is little or no news since I last wrote. The Duveens are pretending to be awfully sick and down hearted over the Chinese Porcelains deal, but of course, they cannot fool <u>me</u> . I know that even if we have made a good bargain, <u>they</u> have made a better one and that they will make at least 2 million dollars out of that collection – so I’m not worrying about their hypocritical tears and laments. Now I’m worrying for fear something may come out about the deal before we are ready – for that would be disastrous all around – After a short rest I am going to start in on the Fragonard room and after that, on the XVIIIth century furniture</p>
