<p>there more than I can tell you – besides BB’s “culture” has quite spoiled me for my ignorant friends! I hope you will forgive this scrawl – but more than that, I hope you will answer it & please tell me all the things about B. B. he won’t tell me himself & all about I Tatti & everyone there & as much as you will about yourself – I shall never forget my trip in Italy</p>
<p>as long as I live nor shall I <u>ever</u> forget your sweet kindness & sincerity to me – I am but a poor scribe as Peter Ibbetson says – but I <u>do</u> love you for it and I do wish there were something I could do for you too – I hope you will ask your daughter to let  me see her if she comes to New York this year – I have never had a chance to really <u>know</u> her at all –</p>
<p>With all my sincere & earnest affection – Belle Greene</p>
