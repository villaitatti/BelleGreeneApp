<p> <u>that</u> needless to say I’d do with pleasure to see you if only for a week – for I don’t see how I’m to get much more time than that – Isn’t it all <u>appalling</u> if only you had been able to come to America – Are you [ <i>double underlined:</i> quite] sure you can’t sail back with me on an <u>American</u> boat from Liverpool say on November 14 or 21 – Is it trouble about a passport you are having although I cannot understand <u>why</u> you should as an American citizen – America seemed pretty poor & rather flat & tiresome to me but [ <i>double underlined:</i> now] oh! Lord – except for you, I’m ready to <u>fly</u> back tomorrow</p>
<p>Personally I don’t think an American is persona grata <u>anywhere</u> as letters take so long to reach you. I’ll <u>telegraph</u> anything important – It seems that letters from Paris to be <u>5</u> days and a telegram to you takes over 24 hours. Don’t leave until you hear from me – unless you want to go to Paris in any case –</p>
<p>Devotedly</p>
