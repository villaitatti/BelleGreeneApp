<p>to put up at a <u>N</u> Hotel and <u>not</u> at your VILLA – as she might possible inconvenience Mary with her maid & all her trunks etc. She finally agreed absolutely to do so. I think this is much better for I really don’t like to feel that I have laid her in Mary’s lap, so to speak. And she can see just as much of you if not more, in this way – you can do just as much for her and it may keep her from interfering in your actual working hours if you have any. Of course, I do feel that being in your vicinity for that length of time will be the <u>making</u> of her. If it is not, then it’s a hopeless case.</p>
<p>In any event, I have done all I can to relieve you of part of the burden – and so unless you honestly, sincerely desire it, you need not ask her to stay in your house.</p>
