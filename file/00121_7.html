<p>love you for that alone if I did not love you for the other million <u>and</u> one reasons – And all they [sic] things you tell me are of such <u>real</u> interest & help to me – I feel <u>so</u> near you tonight darling – the miles & miles & the horrid ocean seem to be utterly eliminated and I am with you – in your arms – beside you</p>
<p>[p. 14]</p>
<p>back of you with my arms around your <s>kne</s> neck – on your knee with your eyes in mon – sitting beside you on the sofa at Claridges while you read me the book of French verse – walking about the narrow streets of Urbino, holding your hand & my breath as I sit beside you in the choir stalls atArrezzo[sic] – oh! dear</p>
