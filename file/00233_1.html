<p><u>Saturday, April 12</u></p>
<p>Dearest B. B. –</p>
<p>I think you will know how almost impossible it is for me to write – but you are all I have left now</p>
<p>He came back to me and the Library he loved <u>so</u> much, last night at six o’clock. We fixed his room for him almost exactly as it was on Christmas </p>
<p>[p. 2]</p>
<p>Day – all red and white roses and a few wreaths. I cannot tell you how <u>beautiful</u> it looks – It has resulted in just what we aimed at – a home coming. </p>
<p>As for me I feel as one enveloped in a dense fog – I can neither think nor see into the future. Not even <u>you,</u> knew all that he was to me – besides every other relation he was a <u>son</u> and a father confessor. </p>
