<p>grown <u>so</u> greedy for your letters my dear – I had a <u>19</u> page epistle from Read written on board the Baltic during his voyage – wish I could tell you about it and I will, when we meet – Gosh – such slobber – I have resolved <u>not</u> to answer it as I don’t want to get in any mixup there – now goodbye – my <u>very</u> veriest Beloved – If I could only make you feel and</p>
<p>know my ever increasing love for you – the daily & almost hourly life I live with you – and how <u>close</u> I feel to you – you are such a dear to me in every way and I feel a sort of “protestingness” from you that I never felt before we parted this time. It is <u>only</u> until next spring you dearest – I want to spent [sic] <u>all</u> of part of my time with you that is <s>either</s> 2 or 3 weeks, either at the beginning or the end –</p>
<p>Ever & Ever <u>Your</u>  <u>Belle</u> </p>
