<p>National Gallery looks <u>wonderful</u> and the Filippo Lippi more beautiful than ever for they have a wonderful greyish brown background – I cannot <u>bear</u> the Turner in with the others – The colours are so garish but as you know and regret I cannot “see” Turner anyhow. The Lady Bette Delmé looks fine and also the Van Dycks and even the Raeburn’s seem to have some value. <u>How</u> I wish that the Crivelli could have been with them! Then </p>
