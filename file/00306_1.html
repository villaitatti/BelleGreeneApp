<p>9 p.m.</p>
<p>B.B. you darrling –</p>
<p>I have had such a strenuous day – all business – that I am quite exhausted – The Congress of Surgeons, which is holding meetings in N.Y. came to the Library in shoals today over 200 including their wives and collaterals – They were of every nation under the sun, mostly German, and I enjoyed talking to them so</p>
<p>much that I was a wreck by one o’clock – A number of them had personal letters to me from stray acquaintances all over the world so that I was able to open the conversation with friendly gossip and afterwards we got into all sorts of discussions – They were all so simple and agreeable that I feel as if I were having a big tea party – They did not all seem to enthuse overCarrell [sic] – admittedhis genius but thought him too sensational and yellow-journalistic – He, unfortunately was operating and could not come – Among others</p>
