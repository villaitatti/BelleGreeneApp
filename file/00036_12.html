<p>as we had – in those two days I lost 50 years of my age. We all acted like tomboys – Lived in our bathing suits until dinner time – swimming, diving, canoeing & feeling altogether as if the great beautiful world belonged to us alone – The boat was built by one of the girl’s father to accommodate six persons & there were fourteen of us on board!
