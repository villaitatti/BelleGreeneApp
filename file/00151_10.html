<p>I have been expecting my photographs every day to send you but they have not yet arrived, I hope you will like them. They are not any good but you know it is difficult to get a good picture of me – I have such a “wriggly” face – Sweetheart I must run now. I will</p>
<p>[p. 20]</p>
<p>write you again this week – I love you dear billions & billions and I am <u>hungry</u> for you. I love your letters, they are so dear and I feel <u>dreadfully</u> when you skipped a day – Daarrling <u>no one</u> but you knows how faithful I can be but you know & you will always know – I feel that I could crush you with kisses dear – I hate to have spring come & not be with you – My mouth is on your mouth & my heart on your heart Ever your Belle</p>
