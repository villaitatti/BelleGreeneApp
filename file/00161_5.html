<p>Summer – Simply to get the family out of town – but <u>believe me</u> it won’t see very much of little Belle – It is far to commute every day & as I have week-end invitations for almost the entire summer I do not see when I can get there.</p>
<p>It’s one of those “cebbrity” colonies – Richard le Gallienne, David Bispham & that crowd – I’ve known them too well to be still interested in them – but the “family” idolize them all so they, at least, will have a good time.</p>
<p>There is absolutely <u>nothing</u> to write you about except the <u>appalling</u> heat – You really cannot imagine how <u>dreadful</u> it is here –</p>
