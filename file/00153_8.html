<p>who had been patiently waiting half an hour – you know, it may seem queer to you, but I have a <u>real</u> affection for Quartich, fat and solemn & porpoise like as he is. And we are [ <i>double underlined</i> : great] friends, he has been of the greatest help to me in many ways – he never seems quite able to make me out</p>
<p>but I think he believes that given time I will amount to something & he does all he can to bring it about – Well we gossiped about every body & every thing and I asked him about Voynitch. He shrugged his shoulders contemptuously and said that Voynitch never bought a thing in the <u>first</u>  <u>instance</u> himself that is he never bought</p>
