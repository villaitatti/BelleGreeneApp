<p>with Mr. Jack – He was in a business meeting here which lasted until eleven so that they were on my hands all that time. I turned Murray over to Thursty to show her the books and she was simply appalled by his knowledge. He really knows pretty much all there is to know about early printed books, so they had a fine pow wow – Read hung about my desk and discoursed about himself in a high and lofty way until I made such fun of his conceit that he quit. Hyvernat came ambling in from Washington – several other men</p>

<p>arrived and believe me there was hullabaloo in my room.</p>
<p>After their conference with Mr. Jack, John Ryan came in and invited us all to luncheon, Read, Murray Hyvernat Thursty & myself. We had a really giddy time at luncheon everybody wanting to talk at once – champagne flowing like water etc. Murray was by far the most interesting and amusing of the whole lot – After luncheon I motored them up to the Museum and delivered them into Robinson's keeping. As I wrote you yesterday, I could not <u>possibly</u> get out</p>
