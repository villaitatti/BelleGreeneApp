<p>Monday April 3 –</p>
<p>Daarrling –</p>
<p>I have just received your letter of March 19 and was as always, overjoyed to have it – While I remember it I want to tell you that I received your photographs and <u>loved</u> them. The standing one was so natural & so</p>
<p>made <u>you</u> as you were when I was with you that it literally made me weep – but I am <u>awfully</u> glad to have them. Also the “Klassikern [sic] der Kunst” came five of them including the Rubens & Van Dyck – I am awfully glad to add them to “our” library and have as yet only looked through them.</p>
