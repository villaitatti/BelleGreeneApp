<p>Mrs Page – wife of the AmericanAmbassadorcalled last week (I never even <u>heard</u> of her in N.Y.)&is giving me a dinner next week – I honestly would have given up 99% of all this if you could have come here – but so long as you cannot I think it very good for my future to take in all I can – It’s lucky you did not arrive when the D–s were here – I did not know of their presence til shortly before they left. They were in Paris when I arrived – & now I must run&unpack&pack again as I did not bring a maid with me – I think I told you of most of my future movements (as regards leaving London) in my yesterdays letters – If you write after the 13thaddress Morgan Grenfell&Co – 22 Old Broad Street who will forward the letters to my boat – Met an officer (wounded) yesterday who had been all through theVerduncampaign It was thrilling</p>
<p>If I don’t see you for <u>ten</u>  <u>years</u> – it willbe lonesome– I shall always be <u>Your</u> Belle</p>
