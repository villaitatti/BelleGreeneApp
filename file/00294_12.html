<p> <u>In</u>  <u>case</u> I receive a letter from you tomorrow morning, definitely ordering me to write for an early Saturday morning mail, of course, I will do so – but not otherwise as I should not wish a letter to reach there <u>after</u> you had left. A busy day ahead with lots of people, a luncheon, dinner & Theatre – no more breaks into my retreat after this B.</p>
