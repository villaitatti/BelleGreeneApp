<p>Today I am going to “lecture” a bunch of boarding school girls at the Library, and if I have time (which I doubt) take them to see the Morgan Collection at the Museum later. Mr. Jack is still living with us – He boomed in this morning and asked me if I thought him well enough to go down town – I promptly told him “certainly not” which he expected so</p>
