<p>I will go to the Hist. Socy as soon as I can find free time for that long journey – and have the photos you indicated made of the Triumph of Fame – I understand that Offner is writing a book about them (including his articles in Art in America) and that he has photographs (many in <u>detail</u> ) of everything – So it might be well for you to get those you need from him, <u>pending</u> the arrival of mine – for you</p>
