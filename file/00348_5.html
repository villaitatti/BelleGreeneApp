<p>letter from Murray on Monday – virtually <u>begging</u> me to treat him kindly when he came over – I had a cable from him yesterday, stating that he was sailing on the 12th. I do not believe he will be here more than a week or ten days as there is virtually nothing for him to do – </p>
<p>In case you <u>do</u> come over, <s>have you</s> don’t forget to let me know what to do about rooms for you–</p>
<p>[p. 10]</p>
<p>Now I must close this <u>very</u> unsatisfactory letter & run back to my work – </p>
<p>I <u>wish</u> I could make you feel just how much and <u>how</u> I love you – I think I could be absolutely happy with you <u>all</u> the time, both day & night and I honestly do not know another living soul of whom I could say that – Goodbye you darling – I kiss your blue, blue eyes – and will kiss <u>more</u> than that when you come – <u>Always</u> Your <u>Belle</u></p>
