<p>You see I have gotten into the horrid habit again of <u>gossiping</u> to you – but it is more writing as thoughtlessly as I might talk to you if you were here –</p>
<p>Mr. Sturgis told me what you probably already know, that Mrs. Lydig, who is a sort of cousin of his, is sailing on</p>
<p>the 27th and is going to liveat theGotham – He told me of an <u>awfully</u> amusing conversation with Phil Lydig the other night – which I willretailto you later. He says too, that he had just that morning received a letter from Mrs. Lydig and that her wound is quite healed and that she feels better than she has for many years – You see how <u>unselfish</u> I am B. B. dear</p>
