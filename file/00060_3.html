<p>interesting talk with him about people and things[.] He has such a fresh vision & a clearly thinking mind that I enjoyed him immensely. He is going over in a few weeks to stay with Beatrice Mills (Lady Granard) so you will probably see him</p>
<p>This morning we spent wandering about the farm, playing tennis & a bit of</p>
<p>golf & several of the men played polo for our benefit, as Mrs. Leeds has a corking field on her place – For luncheon today Mr. and Mrs. Grant (who was Ethel Watts Mumford – a <u>terror</u> whom I <u>love</u> ) came over & brought another Englishman namedWombwell or something like that. He is terrifically good looking & it seems a famous polo player – but impressed me rather as being a spoiled pet of society –</p>
<p>I like Arnold Wood <u>tremendously</u> </p>
