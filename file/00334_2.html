<p> <u>Wednesday, July 8</u> </p>
<p>This morning, Preshus, I received your letter from Paris of June 28–30 – an <u>adorably</u> gossipy letter & the kind you should <u>always</u> write my darrling. I am keen about it all – I am dying to know your Salomon Reinach. He must be enchanting and, as you know, I was much interested in your account of your afternoon with Agoness – the reason she says that under <u>your</u> influence I become “shrill and emphatic” is because I flare up & get vituperative when I think she, or someone who has had equal opportunities</p>
