<p> <u>Thursday, Aug. 3</u> </p>
<p>Well dear – the d—d – old ship is again postponed until <u>tomorrow</u> so I have time for another word –</p>
<p>We had an enormous rail-road meeting here yesterday, about 30 new Directors,Presidentsetc. of all the big lines – I think it is in <u>re</u> the Rate Regulation decision – Mr. Jack bossed the whole job just as his Father used to do – I left here about</p>
<p>7 in the midst of the most dreadful thunderstorms I have ever witnessed – I was frightened almost to death & reached home to find my Mother an hysterical heap on the bed. We none of us could touch any dinner & I proposed to lie down about eight thirty but I was <u>so</u> nervous I could not keep <u>any</u> part of my body still so as the storm had passed, I suggested to Mother that we go out for a walk – We did and afterwards stopped in at a moving-picture</p>
