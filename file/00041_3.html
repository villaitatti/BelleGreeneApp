<p>bit excited by the electrical display. Every building in New York & the entire Fifth Avenue is draped in a hideous combination of orange & blue & red white & blue and at night it is a fairyland thoroughfare of Electric lights. The exhibition of Dutch masters at the Museum is a great success – I could write you forever of the various joys I found there were it not an old story to you – Mr. Robinson took me around one day before it was opened to the public & we had a delightful <u>three</u> hours, I find him universally improved since I last saw him, with a quickened sense of humour & really companionable – Do you know anything of the Duke di Torlonia (I’m not sure that’s right) who lives in Rome? – I have an idea he is a harmless scoundrel but a bit fascinating</p>
<p>I have been meeting some most enchanting people lately of whom we will converse when I next see you – I was pretty sure that your experience with A. – would be as you described – I will tell you what he says to me – I had a most polite note from the beast asking me to come & see his new things but have not had a minute as yet in which to do so. I must retract all I said of his Hals. Valentiner says it is one of the [double-underlined: best]. Write me soon Belle</p>
