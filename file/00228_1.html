<p>Dear B. B. –</p>
<p>I’m temporarily laid up with another cold – nothing at <u>all</u> serious, but tiresome and nerve-racking – because, there is an infernal ceaseless buzzing in my</p>
<p>head & I cant hear anything I say which frightens me almost to death – being of a reckless tongue!! – of news there is absolutely <u>none</u> except that your emaciated Mrs. Lydig is going to sell her art objects at auction</p>
