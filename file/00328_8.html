<p>Murray cannot say that <u>I</u> encouraged Read or played up to him – I treated him always as an admiring but humble & <u>very</u> much younger pupil &c., but Murray felt Read’s attitude [ <i>quadruple underlined:</i> very] keenly toward the last and resented it in his smiling, amused way, but he is not the kind, I am sure, to keep silent under such treatment as Read handed out to him here in the last ten days of their stay – You must be sure to tell me, what, if</p>
<p>anything Agoness says about Read & me – [ <i>double underlined:</i> she] thinks that I was equally crazy about Read & I’m <u>sure</u> she thinks I influenced Read against her, which I swear I did <u>not</u> . She was awfully brazen about Raphael – When she found that Read would not trot her about London (& the awful joke of it is, that he told her so, before me, in almost identically the same way you did about Italy!) she asked Raphael to take her to see Enno’s collection & to the races</p>
