<p>B.B. daarrling [sic] you may think I have a gay and easy life, but I have a great deal, that few know of, to worry me –</p>
<p>My sister as I wrote you has been <u>very</u> ill – she was in the Hospital several months and she has just returned from two weeks at Atlantic City</p>
<p>where I hoped she would be greatly benefited but she came back feeling worse and I am rather at a loss as to what to do about her – I fear we will have to have a consultation of physician – It has been very expensive so far & I fear will be more so before we cure her – Then my mother is a <u>nervous</u> wreck – almost drives me distracted</p>
