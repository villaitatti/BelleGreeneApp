<p>source of much pleasure. I <s>yet</s> get away every Friday night for week end visits with my friends & am going to Newport as I generally do for over the Fourth. <u>Why</u> are you not here you wicked lover? – I must stop now dear as Mrs. Tom Hastings & Frank Crowninshieldhave come in for a dine & I like them both – I will write you</p>
<p>[p. 18]</p>
<p><u>very</u> soon again – meanwhile remember always I love you dearly & never suppose as you said in your letter of the 14th that there is any one else “For I have been faithful to thee, Cynara, in my fashion”–</p>
<p><u>Belle</u></p>
