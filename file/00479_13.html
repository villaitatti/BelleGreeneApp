<p>of Eve, I am at the mercy of my thoughts of You – To date, I have succeed in energetically banishing them to a “to-be-dealt-with-in-the-future” background, by pinning my complete attention upon <u>something</u> every moment – This morning I find my will feeble and tattering I simply <u>cannot</u> stand many more of these inane, end-of the-season dinners, teas etc – I <u>must</u> get to work and <u>you</u> must help keep me busy “dans ma noire Siberia”– I shall probably start at it in my usual selfish way – as you so justly say, impatient of every thing which does not give me a sharp and immediate sensation – Volupté grise,alas – There is not much use in saying anything about <u>us</u> – is there ? “ô douceur – ô poison” <u>Belle</u> </p>
