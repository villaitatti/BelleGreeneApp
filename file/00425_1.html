<p><u>Wednesday Nov. 15</u></p>
<p>Dear B.B –</p>
<p>Just a line before I run off to inspect the mss. in the British Museum – I received this morning your letter of Nov. 12 (only 3 days!!) now I want you to sit down & write me in <u>detail</u> all & anything you have heard of me & French & Co – I will write inside <u>at length</u> en route to </p>
<p>[p. 2]</p>
<p>Cambridge tomorrow. I am so full up today – up to a state dinner tonight that I will not have a chance before – <u>Don’t generalize</u> – tell me the names of persons who told you & the names of persons who told them – Joe pretends to adore you & to be very friendly with me, but he watches me like a cat –</p>
<p>I enclose a letter from Martin Egan – one of the partners in J.P.M. & Co.</p>
