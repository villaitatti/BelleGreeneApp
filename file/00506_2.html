<p>you by Offner when he flys [sic] you-ward – I see him <u>very</u> little – he does not like me at all. Isn't it sad! I am going to Baltimore tomorrow to stay with Alice Garrett – Mr. Walters thinks he will be there at the same time – In any case I am, of course, going to put in as much time as I can at his gallery, and think I'll take a shot on trying to get some of his manuscripts from him – The big Armenian one – and the little 13 cent Psalter – doubtless others which I do not remember – I'll be interested to see your article of the Berry antiphonarium – I wonder if it is as good – or better than ours?</p>
<p>We have had a shower of delightful 'furriners' over here this season – As usual, I like the Britishers best, but the others have helped to make life gay – I do <s>wish I’d</s> hope I'll soon work through this second flaming youth which has attacked me. The demands of it are reducing me to skin and bones –</p>
<p>Ain't this the neat autography? – It's in the nature of a Penance – sorry I cannot tell you for what (no – <u>not</u> for <u>that</u> common stunt of which you're thinking!)</p>
<p>Yours ETC-</p>
<p> <u>B.G.</u> </p>
<p>P.S. I'm glad to think that this script will make for a change!</p>
