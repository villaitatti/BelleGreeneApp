<p>stairs – she, as well as Mrs. Van Rensellaer (can't spell it!!) are quite spellbound by Meyer–Riefstahl's fascinations It would probably make Mrs. Ned very unhappy if she knew how very much he preferred me to them all – I am really quite grateful to him for a lot he has taught me but the <u>German</u> in him drives me mad – He knows it and understands it perfectly which is quite wonderful. I told him the other day that we could be very good friends if he were only French. He was much insulted at first, but later on said that he <u>knew</u> he often rubbed me the wrong way – which is true. I'll be in the midst of a charming conversation with him when he will exhibit some German gesture or trick of speech & in a second I am all </p>
