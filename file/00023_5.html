<p>miles of space – I feel wrapped in your tenderness and am certain that you will never tear the gossamer of my love for you – As some wise beau has truly said – “the interpretation of what is best in life will ever be love and what its personal relations lead us toward” and I cling to the hope that ours will lead us along the path of the hidden</p>
<p>joys of life “till end be ended and till ceasing cease” –</p>
<p>I wonder if you felt that I was signally [sic] you through the space of the wonderful night tonight? I tried desperately hard to “get you” but in vain –</p>
<p>I came into town this morning for the Sands’ Gambol which was rather amusing and after wards was motored out to Wodmanston [sic] Inn (beyond Pelham) for supper</p>
