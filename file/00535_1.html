<p>[p. 1]</p>
<p>Wednesday 8 July,</p>
<p>B.B. you are, at last, a great Big DIVINE Critter –</p>
<p>I’ve had a long powwow with Paul Sachs today & he told me the <u>glorious</u> news, which for the moment of course, he is keeping confidential – I am so thrilled and pleased & happy for & about you that you should have done it so <u>handsomely</u> , so really</p>
<p>[p. 2]</p>
<p>beautifully. Sachs was tremendously impressed by your attitude about it all and he gave me a most solemn promise that he would <u>devote</u> himself to the spirit and meaning of <u>I Tatti</u> (which exists nowhere else) with even <u>more</u> love, enthusiasm & zeal, than he had to the Fogg.</p>
<p>I shan’t see him again before I sail, but he is sending me your letters in a few days now &</p>
