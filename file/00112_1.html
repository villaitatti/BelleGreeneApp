<p>Saturday, Dec. 31. 11 p.m.</p>
<p>Daarrling – I want my last letter of 1910 to be to you and my last thoughts in the year to be of you and only you and my first thoughts in 1911 to be of you and only you – so I have just come in from a large dinner at John</p>
<p>Cadwalader’s and although I am supposed to appear at a grand party in half an hour to help usher in the New Year I shall not go until almost one o’clock <s>dar</s> for daarrling I don’t just know why but I feel so <u>very</u> strongly that I want to consecrate these two hours, the last in the old & the first in the New</p>
