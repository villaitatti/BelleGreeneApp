<p>tried to get it as a whole, and in consequence – spat it out from the rectum – It was if I had eaten a meal composed of slightly-tainted bortsch, lobster, <u>high</u> game, mildewed salad, long-over-sunned tomatoes, mouldy foie-gras etc etc, without the alleviating black coffee – Then God inspired me to loaf out to a place I had never heard of before, but saw on the horizon, one Malamocco – for an afternoon and a night which lasted until 1 a.m., reaching here at 3 a.m. – and I was cleansed & purged of the little mind & soul which is left to me, came back <u>sane</u>, so that now I <u>see</u> it & pass up the indigestible over-ripe dishes</p>
<p>Best of all I love the stones – Everywhere, I wonder why – When they also so obviously loved them – they didn’t pass up 90% of the painting – and tell their story & their glory (such a boastful vaunting glory) with the stones!</p>
<p>There is a tiny little church, S. Maria de Miracoli, where I go and <u>sit</u>, now almost without looking, for at least 15 minutes every day – It – and the Armenian Monastery, are all the rest I have known here (my bed never <u>rests</u> me – it just supports a no-account body) – but that church seeps enough quiet beauty into my body to keep me on my feet for the <u>chores</u> I must do –</p>
<p><u>All</u> the fathers at <s>the</s> San Lazzaro and I are <u>as one</u> – They cluster about as the birds did for S. Francis – no duties, prayers, or anything else is performed when I am there, so now I have learned their hours & go <u>between</u> the hours of duties & never stay more than 2 hours at the most – I dare</p>
