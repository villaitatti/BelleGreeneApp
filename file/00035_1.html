<p>Tuesday evening</p>
<p>August 3 –</p>
<p>Dear sweet Beloved</p>
<p>I am so filled with the thought of you – so enveloped by my love for you that I wonder at myself to a degree at which I am lost and then I just leave off making futile demands upon my reasoning powers and give myself completely up to the joy it gives me to love you – and yet – being at want of some sense – I do</p>
<p>not doubt that the very fact that I was with you so short a time has enhanced my idea of you – not to know all, to see miles of untrodden way stretching ahead leaves one queen of ecstatic possibilities with a limitless play ground for one’s imagination & I wonder if any living being has greater imaginative powers than I – Since my childhood I have lived in them and now with their aid my love for you runs absolute riot. Every nerve in my body responds to my thoughts of you. I lay my arms about your neck & cose my cheek</p>
