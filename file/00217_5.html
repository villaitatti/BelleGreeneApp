<p>Blumenthal told me he had bought a number of paintings from Perkins – I’m dying to see them. I’m going up there to lunch on Sunday and will write you about them after that. I have not yet received my</p>
<p>Daddi painting – You can imagine how <u>wildly</u> excited I am at the thought of having it – and having it from you – It is so wonderful of you to send me such and [sic] <u>adorable</u> gift & I shall love it doubly well – I will cable the minute it comes –</p>
