<p>most curious creature – shadow of Fitz – & who in his own selfish way was extremely kind to me – He has several things I adore – but most of all a Holbein miniature of Anne of Cleves</p>
<p>Beloved, I found that, in my usual wild and scatter brained way, I sent you the wrong Laffan letter! – true to my southern birth and blood which has a firm belief in “signs and omens –” I concluded in the mistake was the hand of my Guardian angel (masculine!) and that I ought not to send you the Raphael one – I therefore destroyed it – However I shall see the gentleman “face to face” within a day or two and I will be able to write you the truth – or so much of it as he is capable of telling!</p>
