<p>Monday Dec. 7 –</p>
<p>Dearest B.B. –</p>
<p>The mails are <u>quite</u> horrid now – the boats leaving once a week or once in ten days only – I have quite loved and devoured your letters from France, that mail reaching us, for some reason, more regularly than the English mail –</p>
<p>I was so villainously interrupted in my last letter that I did not have a chance to tell you, as I wanted to,</p>
<p>[p. 2]</p>
<p>about Fairfax Murray – I may say, without any conceit but with unqualified pleasure, that some of the best and most adroit work I have ever done has been in connection with him. I have not only <u>finished</u> him for Jack Morgan – but think I have achieved the same results with Duveen –</p>
<p> <u>Tuesday Dec. 8</u> –</p>
<p>Well dear, <u>as usual</u> (damn it) I was interrupted after that last sentence yesterday</p>
