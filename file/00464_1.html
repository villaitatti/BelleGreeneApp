<p>31 Dec. 1920 –</p>
<p>Dear B.B. –</p>
<p>All hail & wishes for 1921 – Hope it will prove more "heureuse"than 1920.</p>
<p>As my cold hangs on distressingly & everyone prophesies that I shall shortly pass out wrapped in the arms of pneumonia, I'm <u>not</u> a very cheerful person and except when I lose all thought of myself in work – do not feel up to much – I have dined out (or gone out in the evenings)</p>
