<p>a few giddy & attractive ladies who have arrived lately including Mrs. W. K. Vanderbilt jr whom I detest – an underbred – underborn impossible creature – for whose husband – (a rotten branch of a rotten tree) – I have <s>great</s> some sympathy. There is a youth here who is firmly convinced that he is my Heaven Sent affinity and when he does not drive me distracted with his youth and insistence – he amuses me greatly; then there is a round young man who seems to feel that I <u>owe</u> </p>
<p>him a large amount of affection & also my society. He is fat and <u>porous</u> and his only claim to distinction is that Locke dedicated Septimus to him – For that reason I endure him – as I adore Septimus – It would bore you to tell you of the rest of this house party – It is the regulations kind with no celebrities to alleviate – & you would scorn us all – I feel and act like a kid of sixteen – & these infant boys really think I am Helas! –</p>
