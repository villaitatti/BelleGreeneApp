<p>Washington & from there I learn they were opened & returned to the address within – <u>Therefore</u> , I presume one went back to Paris & the others to I Tatti – I have been sailing all day & dancing all evening and am too tired (not to say sunburned & warm!) to write more. Did you go to the Reid ball? It must have been very fine – I am <u>so</u> over <u>joyed</u> that my dear Boss is returning!! As for <u>you</u> I could shake you & kiss you in the same moment –</p>
<p>Devotedly</p>
<p> <u>Belle</u> .</p>
