You are mine and I am yours forever and a day – “I will not let thee go” – I love your letters, I <u>do</u> love them so much & I love to feel that you think of me so often. You are never really absent from mythoughts <u>never</u> for <u>one</u> instant. I kiss you dear and wish that I were with you or you with me – Love me heaps as I love you – <u>Your</u> Belle –</p>
