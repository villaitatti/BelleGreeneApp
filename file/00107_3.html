<p>is taking all my time and attention now – I am fixing it with a view to your staying there with me whenever you come out – It can be perfectly easily arranged – The Customs People (damn them!) are now trying to get hold of Imbert – but I have not heard of any thing against the Seligmann’s – Rey promised to take you heaps of my love when he went over. I hope the weight of it does</p>

<p>not sink his ship –</p>
<p>Fiamma mia I <u>love</u> you & <u>cherish</u> you and <u>worship</u> you. You are mine and I am yours forever and a day – “I will not let thee go” – I love your letters, I <u>do</u> love them so much & I love to feel that you think of me so often. You are never really absent from my thoughts <u>never</u> for <u>one</u> instant. I kiss you dear and wish that I were with you or you with me – Love me heaps as I love you – <u>Your</u> Belle –</p>
