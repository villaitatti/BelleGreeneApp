<p>Tuesday Dec. 5</p>
<p>Dear dear B. B.</p>
<p>I <u>cannot</u> understand your not receiving the letter I wroteby theMauretania. It was the longest letter I ever wrote in my life and I told you so much</p>
<p>[p. 2]</p>
<p>inthere that itseems to me I can never <u>write</u> again – I am equally distressed over Mary’s letter to me and your own which came this week, Iimagine you <u>cannot</u> believe I love you but I <u>do</u> – I simply cannot write. I sit down with a pen and paper</p>
