<p>shall now close this letter and send it off by the Olympic <s>while</s> wish I could put myself on board also.</p>
<p>Freer came in to see me yesterday – unfortunately I was horribly busy as Jack was here and half a dozen other people so I could only see him for a little time – He was <u>very</u> weak and his voice almost gone Congratulated me heartily on the acquisition of the jade and said he <u>loved</u> the group which he had seen many years ago in Prince Tang (?) collection but it was too expensive for him</p>
<p>He also is sending me the facsimiles of his Greek Gospels to send to you – He is leaving for Atlantic City today – Jack Morgan would not see him at all – said he had always despised him and as long as he did not have his treasures along, saw no value in him – I found him rather wandering mentally and uninteresting and very hard to get rid of. Now I must run dear</p>
<p>Write me <u>all</u> your thoughts & be very much my lover always Your Belle</p>
