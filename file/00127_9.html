<p> <u>dared</u> do so yet – I must wait until I am quite calm and cool and emotionless – Will such a time <u>ever</u> come do you think?</p>
<p>Daarrling I <u>cannot</u> write to you any more tonight – if I did – it would be to tell you all the different ways I love you – and I love</p>
<p>you so <u>very</u> much today, almost more than I Ever have – Daarrling it makes me rage and weep & [ <i>double underlined</i> : sick] to think I may become – or am now a drag upon you – I can’t <u>bear</u> it – I simply cannot <u>bear</u> it – oh! if you were only here – I <u>know</u> you would comfort me –</p>
<p>I feel like a cork adrift on the ocean – I want to be in your arms and whisper in your ear – <u>Ever your</u> Belle –</p>
