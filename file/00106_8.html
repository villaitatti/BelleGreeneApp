<p>wrote Lydig – Bless your soul when the day & the afternoon of the day came J. P. refused <u>absolutely</u> to see them & when I said – “well, I’ll bring them right in your room and you can’t help yourself” he jumped up, jumped into his motor & went downtown. It was an hour before they were to come and I was simply <u>aghast</u> – but I made up my mind that I would not be bothered with them so Itelephoned to Mrs.L. & told her, he was suddenly called to a meeting. She wrote me a charming note the next day and askedme <u>please</u> totelephone her <u>any</u> day when she could see him – which of course I shall never do – Isn’t he a <u>pig</u> ? He sees lots of worse people –</p>
