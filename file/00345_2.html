<p>the whole world outside is being upset. I was asked to be Chairman of one of the Red Cross committees and said I would undertake it provided the money were sent to the <u>English</u> Red Cross – but they indignantly replied that "mercy knew no coste, [sic] creed color etc” so <u>I</u> dropped out – I have no intention whatever of gathering money to take care of German wounded – Leave 'em rot is my nasty motto – I am going to visit the John Ryan’s at Prides Crossing today until Monday Will write again then. Ever Your Belle</p>
<p> <u>Monday Aug.10</u> </p>
<p>You <u>very most Belovedest</u> </p>
<p>I have just received your  London letter of July 30-31 – By this time I hope you have decided to come over here – There is just the chance that you may feel that you ought to be in Italy to protect your interests there – otherwise, as an American citizen I should think <u>this</u> would be your natural place – Mr. Jack M. has been doing <u>great</u> work. As you know the Bank of France deposited something like ten million dollars</p>
