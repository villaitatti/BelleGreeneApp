<p>Dearest B.B – </p>
<p>Just a line today au revoir for over a fortnight for you cannot get any steamer letter before then. I have not yet received the letter of which you telegraphed me – <u>Why</u> did you not send it to the [<i>double underlined: </i>steamer]!! as it will doubtless arrive tomorrow Have left strict orders here to have it forwarded</p>

<p>I have been so spoiled here I hate to go home Had a wonderful luncheon given me today & sat beside the enchanting Col. Repington – the military writer of the Times – they are all so dear to me & I hate. hate. [<i>double underlined: </i>hate] to go – Dear Cockerell come all the way up from Cambridge to say goodbye & brought me all sorts of literary presents – You <u>must </u>tell me all</p>
