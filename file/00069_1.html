<p>Dearest love –</p>
<p>I was so <u>overjoyed</u> today to have your two notes, brief though they were and your cable later. Before I forget I must tell you that it is because you had <u>misspelled</u> my code name that you had trouble – the name is [in printed hand: Morglib] (Morgan-Library) & you had spelled it M <u>a</u> rgl <u>a</u> b, but they are</p>
<p>very clever here and finally it reached me – Do be careful in the future you careless lover – it is great to have the suspense of having & knowing you to be ill – over & done with. I was quite worn out with anxiety about you dear which made me realize as I had scarcely done before how much, how very much I love you and how much you mean in my life – I am glad to learn from</p>
