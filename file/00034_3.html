<p>She spent most of the time telling me what a wonderful person she was & how every one of any importance (especially in the art world) was her intimate friend (I think you were one of them as I remember) I said little to her & listened amusedly; and learned later that she had told me many untruths & that many of the people she claimed to know so well did not know her at all – I do not know any one who knows her. She told me Fry was at her feet most of the time but as he had gone abroad when I returned I have never been able to learn if that too was part of her vivid imagination. She claims Mrs. Gardner as her soul-mate & I had lots of fun teasing her about Mrs. G. – I said all sorts of nasty things which riled her & told her that everybody that I knew thought Mrs. G. impossible socially & she immediately replied that I dicouldn’t know any body of importance as she was the social leader of Boston & America –</p>
<p>As to her work I know nothing as I can find no-one of my acquaintance who knows her – but she virtually told me that she wrote all of La Farge’s</p>
