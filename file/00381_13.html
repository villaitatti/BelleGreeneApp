<p>Frick had both been here, that Knoedler is after the Fragonard’s and Glaenzer for Seligmann interested in the furniture etc. we had a long confer this morning and I am to meet them at 6 o’clock tonight to see if I am <u>willing</u> to draw up some preliminary papers – D. seems to have a large and efficient corps of well trained spies everywhere – They know everyone who comes here – but as that only makes them the more anxious to buy I don’t care and laugh. </p>
