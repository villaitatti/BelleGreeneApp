<p>the singing streams – to all but the mystery of our love and your dear heart –</p>
<p>I love your letters – all of them – and am so interested in all that you do –</p>
<p>Your last letter brought with it a strong touch of your dear self – It gave me a sense of your loving thought which is very dear to me – I trust the day may come</p>
<p>when sans peur et sans reprocheI can be all that you wish to you</p>
<p>Toute à toi</p>
<p> <u>Belle.</u> </p>
