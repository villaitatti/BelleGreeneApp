Mr. S. thinks that your <u>Frau</u> is more dangerous than <u>you</u> which I think is highly complimentary to her – I wish I had time to write you <u>lots</u> of other amusing experiences I have had – but my days are so crowded with them, it is impossible. Someday we can <u>compare</u> notes and be mutually entertained. I dined with some artist folks the other night & the conversation got around to Jaccaci – a clever architect named Brunner seemed to feel quite as strongly about him as you do & said he was in every way despicable. He knows <u>Mrs. J.</u> </p>
