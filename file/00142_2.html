<p>I enclose a letter from Miss Thurston which may amuse you – Babbott is a fool – but wise.</p>
<p>She (Thurston) is really worth while even if you don’t think so – I am <u>dreadfully</u> excited over the prospect of having the pre-Duccio Madonna – What a great <u>dear</u> you are</p>
<p>[p. 4]</p>
<p>to me – Indeed it shall go by my bed where I shall lie and look at it for hours – Isn’t it <u>too</u> thrilling that I should have [<i>triple underlined</i>: 2] primitives in my tiny little apartment? My heart thanks you daarrling, endlessly – You <s>are</s> [^have^] probably seen all of my pet friends in Florence by the time this reaches you – Thursty was due there the seventh and J. P. the <s>8th</s> 1st I believe.</p>
