<p>of the things she had been doing besides taking her cure, when she had been abroad – Lord! What a waste of time! You harangue <u>me</u>, why don’t you tell <u>her</u> how she is throwing her life away? She tried to get me talking about Italy but I had no intention of giving <u>her</u> any information, so I changed the subject to politics & then she <u>did</u> talk nonsense – She is a rabid insurgent so we soon came to blows – She asked me again to talk to Father about her but I told her it was <u>absolutely</u> impossible for me to do so – So then I told her Williamson was on board & crazy to meet her & that sent her off flying – I was glad to have her go for I don’t enjoy talking to her at all – I never feel quite natural & free & I don’t like her talk – it seems all explosives & nothing else & somehow she <u>always</u> rubs me the wrong way & makes me feel contrary & rebellious – P. G. & Ethel cornered me before luncheon and both of them very seriously begged me to give up my idea of marrying for money and I finally told them that I had no idea of doing so for several years at least, unless some unforseen [sic] event made it imperative. I could see that they had been talking it over a great deal amongst themselves. I am [<i>double underlined</i>: so] tired of people interfering in my affairs – I am <u>never</u> going to tell [<i>double underlined</i>: anyone] [<i>triple underlined</i>: any thing] again! – except <u>you</u> and I’m going to tell you <u>every thing</u> – if you want to hear it – This letter is getting to</p>
