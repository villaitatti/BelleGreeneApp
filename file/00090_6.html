<p>lunch with some awfullygoodlookingCaptains at the Tower – say goodbye to Ethel Harrison – the Yates Thompsons –Lady Algy– & some others – have tea with Ellis Robbins – then dine & go to see Inconstant George – & the [ <i>double underlined</i> : only] reason I don’t write to you for an hour further at least is that I must start out if I’m to accomplish it all – If I am not <u>too</u> exhausted when I return from thetheatretonight I will write you again – I went to the National Gallery for an hour yesterday and had a truly <u>divine</u> time – but oh! my dear, it made tears come to my eyes, truly, as I looked at your pet things & realized you were not there & could not be there for perhaps a year – Whata stupidI was not to let you come when you wanted to.
