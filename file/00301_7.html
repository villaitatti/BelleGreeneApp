<p>infinitely prefer to spend the afternoon with the paintings, but that Dr. Ross had been so very kind as to offer to take me through the Museum and as I did not know him at <u>all</u> and had no claim upon him, I felt it so very kind that I could not think of breaking the appointment; so I left the conceited, pompous, but still charming Lodge. He promised to come to see me when he comes to New York next week and I hope he does. He wants me</p>
<p>to go to see Worch things with him and I told him I would with joy – He’s quite stiff & “official” at first but became quite human and almost boyish before we parted – Now for the afternoon performance – I met “Old Dr. Ross” in the room of Persian miniatures & was absolutely <u>sickened</u> by his talk about the dirty, filthy Indian examples he has there. The dirtiest, smudgiest dreariest colours he raved about and called every other thing in the placeBelizod– I really (at that time) did not see <u>how</u> you could praise his “knowing” and feeling so highly</p>
