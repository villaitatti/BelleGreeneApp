<p>Thursday March 16</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>My daarrling love –</p>
<p>Your letter of the 6th received today and telling me of the accident to you has filled me with <u>anguish</u> – daarrling won’t you <u>please</u> be careful – It is pure selfishness on my part for it is because I hate to be made sickeningly unhappy that I don’t want anything to happen to you – I really</p>
<p>grew cold & dizzy when I read that you had been so near a bad accident – Fortunately you were with your dear friends who, I am sure, did everything for you – but <u>please</u> , dear-heart be careful – for <u>my</u> sake –</p>
<p>I am <u>so</u> happy that you had my letters at last & that you liked them. Heaven knows why – <u>I</u> don’t – I dislike writing extremely and I never haveany thing</p>
