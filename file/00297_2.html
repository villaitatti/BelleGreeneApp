<p>with my mood (which is just <u>blue</u> , [ <i>triple underlined</i> : not] despondent!) It is horrid and damp & dark & rainy and I am more than it all. My cold is almost unbearable this morning I shall stay here as long as I can stand it and then go up to the Doctor’s – then home to bed until Monday – On Monday I shall go up to see my Jade again.</p>
<p>I think you would be very glad darling if you if you knew how much</p>
