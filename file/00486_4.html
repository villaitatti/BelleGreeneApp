<p>you – a never ceasing source of aggravation.</p>
<p>Now, you dear, please <u>don’t</u> be bromidic and write back “Your age aggravates me only because I love you so much and in comparison with your hoary years, you are so utterly green – ignorant – unlettered – uncultivated – unworthy – disapproved of – or what not – and <u>I</u> – See what <u>I am</u>!!”</p>
<p>And B.G. replies “Dear Gawd – ain’t <u>one</u> of <u>you</u> enough for the world?” –</p>
<p>Goodbye dear </p>
<p>E. Y. <u>Belle.</u></p>
