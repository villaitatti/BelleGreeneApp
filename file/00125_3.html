<p>A man named Stern, supposed to represent Duveen, came in the other day to see J.P. & told me, <u>in confidence</u> – that the government had made Duveen a definite proposition of Settlement <s>of</s> for$2,000,000 to be paid by Duveen & imprisonment for <u>Ben</u> D. – for one month – J. P. says it’s absurd, they can’t do it but I have been told twice by a U.S. Senator that it will be done as they have been proven to be nothing more than low, common thieves</p>
<p>It’s what I <u>always</u> felt about them – they rob the people they buy from – they rob the people they <u>sell to</u> and the [sic] rob the government – They are now trying to make ithotfor Imbert of Rome (whom I <u>loathe</u> ) and have been up to see four pictures he sold J.P. – What makes me laugh & cry at the same time is that they are all fakes orrotters– What I call “near” Botticellis, Bellinis etc. The government</p>
