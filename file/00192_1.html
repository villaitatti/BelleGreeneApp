<p> <u>Friday</u>  <u>April 26</u> </p>
<p>Dear B. B. –</p>
<p>I’m in a rather perturbed frame of mind as I have just come from a suffrage meeting and I declare I believe I’m won over. At least I immediately sent in my resignation</p>
<p>to the “Anti’s” – I won’t go so far as to march in the “peerade” which they are going to hold, 10,000 strong next Saturday but I <u>won’t</u> either fight them any longer –</p>
<p>As a whole they’re a pretty competent set of women and certainly I am more of their</p>
