<p>buy Duveen’s Crivelli (which I <u>adore</u>) but I have no real hopes of their doing so. They much prefer to buy 3 dozen fourth rate pictures for [ˆ$ˆ]100,000. than one masterpiece – They have been buying some horrible trash in the picture line and you would laugh if you could see the size of the bids they send over for foreign sales such as the Dallpus, Taylor & Doncet – They cannot even enter the auction rooms with them, much less carry away anything. </p>
<p>As far as I can find the persons who <u>prefer</u> the trash and visit upon buying it are Johnson and Robert de Forest</p>
