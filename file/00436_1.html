<p> <u>Sept 5. 1919</u> </p>
<p>Dearest B.B.</p>
<p>This is <u>just</u> a line to catch the boat tomorrow.</p>
<p>First to thank you for your letter, which I presume I do <u>not</u> deserve	– second to tell you – honest injun – that I can no more keep loving you <u>always</u> than I can keep flirting – always –</p>
<p>[p. 2]</p>
<p>I really want to write you all about it sometime – that is all about why I could never stop loving you. Even if I do not write for years or do not hear from you for years –</p>
<p>But I only have time in this to state it as a <u>fact</u> .</p>
<p>I know now that any really, way-down-deep feeling only comes</p>
