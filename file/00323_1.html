<p>Saturday, May 30 –</p>
<p>Darlingest – This is our great Decoration Day – really a messy Labor day – when the masses pic <s>k</s> nic in the park, the streets and in fact all over the City. I have had most of my weekend plans broken up by my two male infants so am going up to Eugene Meyer’s Farm to join them all this afternoon. Much as I love Read, I shall be a wee bit glad when he goes back as I have not a free minute</p>

<p>to myself – <u>Later midnight</u> </p>
<p>Dearest B.B. (myy angel)</p>
<p>I brought this beginning of a letter to the Farm with me and I am writing this in bed, when I am supposed to be asleep. I got up here at 6:30 and found Eugene, Read & Raphael, hilariously gay from some bare-footed and bare-faced dancing they had witnessed in the Greek theatre at Mt. Kisco – I proceeded to sober them up – We went for a little walk and then had an A. no. 1 dinner. After dinner we went out in Eugene’s new motor</p>
