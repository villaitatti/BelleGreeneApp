<p>Dearest – You see I simply <u>cannot</u> stop writing. I am furious with Putnam for not being nicer to you – I’ll “beat him up” when I see him – I know all about the <u>Kent</u> matter (him as was offered my job) – Junius Morgan, who at that time was a member of the Grolier Club tried to get him – and it is true that he was offered the job – [ <i>quintuple underlined</i> : but] at $3000. per annum –</p>
<p>I doubt if he is getting more than $5,000. now at the Museum, if that much – so the Joke is on him – at least for the present of course he may be a museum director some day</p>
<p>I think I would have been a much nicer person if I had not taken or “ <u>gotten</u> ” my present job – <u>but</u> I would have been married – perhaps to a Princeton man – more</p>
