<p>Dear B. B. –</p>
<p>I have not written you before because I am simply frantically busy trying to get out this –!–!–!– inventory of the books and art objects here – You see I have to list and price <u>each</u> book and there are over 20,000., and it is no joke – I neither eat, nor sleep – nor do I see aught of nature, man or beast – I am now staying in town, as I am detained at the Library often until 10, 11 or 12 p.m –</p>
<p>You know I am so scatter brained that I am going to pull Time’s forelock and ask you <u>now</u> if you wish me to engage</p>
