<p>laid down for him here.</p>
<p>Tomorrow (Saturday) I go down to the Holford’s place in Tetbury for the week-end & will try to write you from there after I go up to my rooms in the evening.</p>
<p>How I <u>hate</u> to go back & how I wish I were coming on to you I wrote Jacques S. quite fully telling him I could under no circumstances accept his offer through Glaenzer & in plain terms showed him that it was because he would to be no part in the Morgan sales that he had lost, for a long time to come, his hold in America –</p>
<p>I’ll bet he’ll fly with a howling rage when he reads the letter for I certainly did not mince matters</p>
<p>Now to business – write & tell me <u>how</u> much you are tied up with the Duveens – For instance could you do anything or would you care to do anything for any other dealer in the way of <u>finding</u> & advising them of <u>very</u> fine & important Italian paintings or sculptures for sale? – Don’t be piggy & “shy” but let me know in plain words – I love you & kiss your mouth – <u>Your</u>  <u>very</u>  <u>own</u> Belle</p>
