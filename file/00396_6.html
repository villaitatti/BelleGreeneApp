<p>necessity of a letter or to send one – In fact the men tell me that even my conversation is wrapped around you so to speak – I think Stein, of them all, resents this most. The only quarrel we ever have is that he seems to feel that he is (nearly!) in <u>your</u> class. Needless to say I have done everything to disabuse him of this idea Freer and I talk of you a <u>great</u> deal –</p>
<p>I find my little house quite delightful – <s>in the sense</s> for the reason than I can keep people away so much more than I could in the apartment – now I must tell you that I have quite definitely decided that if it is possible for me to take the ocean trip, I can come over to Italy sometime between June and October but alas for only six weeks. I told Mr. Jack before he left for England & he heartily agreed on the condition that the ocean travel was proved safe – </p>
<p>of course if you can come here I will stay here and go off somewhere with you –</p>
