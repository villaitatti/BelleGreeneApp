<p>THE TURN OF THE ROAD</p>
<p>By ALICE ROLLITT COE.</p>
<p>Soft, gray buds on the willow,</p>
<p>Warm, moist winds from the bay,</p>
<p>Sea-gulls out on the sandy beach,</p>
<p>And a road my eager feet would reach,</p>
<p>That leads to the Far-away.</p>
<p>Dust on the wayside flower,</p>
<p>The meadow-lark’s luring tone</p>
<p>Is silent now, from the grasses tipped</p>
<p>With dew at the dawn, the pearls have slipped –</p>
<p>Far have I fared alone.</p>
<p>And then, by the alder thicket</p>
<p>The turn of the road – and you!</p>
<p>Though the earth lie white in the noonday heat,</p>
<p>Or the swift storm follow our hurrying feet,</p>
<p>What do we care – we two!</p>
<p>– From Scribner’s Magazine for March.]</p>
<p>Oh! For a turn of the road – and <u>you</u> !</p>
