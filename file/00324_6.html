<p>a youth from Boston came to my house for tea (his name was Steele) and the Trio were there – Steele had some messages for me from Denman Ross and proceeded to deliver them amidst grunts and groans from Murray who loathes, despises and abominates Ross – finally to change the dreadful subject I began to tell Steele of the really delightful portraits that Murray had made of my friend Nancy Furst – when the irresistible</p>
<p>and unrepressible [sic] Steele breaks in with “Have you seen Ross’ painting? You know <u>Berenson</u> says he is one of the three greatest painters of the last century” – <u>that</u> was the last straw – Murray got up on his bandy legs – took his hat and as he went to the door, threw over his shoulder “Why drag in the other two?”</p>
<p>Murray was <u>so</u> disagreeable that I just let him go</p>
