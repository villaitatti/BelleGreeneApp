<p>July <u>17.</u></p>
<p>Dear B.B. –</p>
<p>I am quite cross with myself today on receiving a letter from you from <u>London</u> for I sent my last to the Ritz <u>Paris</u> – thinking your friends would surely succeed in persuading you to stay there longer. I am glad you are having such a restful time</p>
<p>[p. 2]</p>
<p>in London but you still seem to be far from strong – it <u>really</u> distresses me – I shall be glad when you get over here and I can see for myself how you are and thus determine on a “treatment” for you – Do bring over photographs of your new acquisitions with you – I shall be so anxious to see them. Especially the Persian things –</p>
<p>I presume you saw the notice on this month’s Burlington</p>
