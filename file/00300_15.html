<p>the Domenico Veneziano at Bohler’s! Gawd save that poor dame – She must have been a harlot to deserve such retribution – He groaned because he had let one <u>shadow</u> slip into his picture! also a poor shivering, half starved boy, in the manner of Vermeer! By the way, his nude boy, he says, is in the manner of Piero della Francesca – It’s a crime that neither God nor the Devil gave that poor old man</p>
<p>“manner” of his own – Now I know about your portrait – It’s painted in the <u>manner</u> of a Revengeful Christ! —</p>
<p>But Ross seems to be a kind old boy of corn meal and simple and unspoiled – He really was kind to me, as I suppose he is to everyone – He said that if I had time, he would like to take me through the Museum tomorrow so we have made a date for 3 p.m. to meet there, I’ll have more to tell you of him tomorrow evening. I went over to Forbes house after leaving Ross to see the Ghirlandaijo [sic] – which Forbes tells me he bought for £300 – in Florence – I liked it very much</p>
