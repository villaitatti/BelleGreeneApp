<p>Friday morning –</p>
<p>Dear I fear I wrote you a very horrid tearsome letter last night and as I <u>never</u> reread a letter for fear of not sending it I shall let it go. I love you very much – I have never <s>felt</s> had the <u>same</u> feeling for anyone else – I</p>
<p>hope I never shall –</p>
<p>Dear let’s <u>be</u> the exceptions and have our love outlive us and as you say let it be light and joy to us throughout our lives – above all let it be worthy. You ask me to tell you all my “naughty” feelings – my hunger for you my jealousy of you – I think you know them all – I have <u>fears</u> that are unworthy of us both and especially unworthy of the <u>kind</u> of love I want ours to be <s>and</s> </p>
