<p>Friday <u>Feb. 21. 1919</u> </p>
<p>Dear B.B –</p>
<p>I am quite distressed and – (I must admit that the little devils inside of me, are highly amused, – ) by your letter of Feb. 4th which I received this morning – You are so <u>evidently</u> bored (and a bit distracted) at the thought of my descending upon you – either in Paris or elsewhere – Don't worry, you dear – from your letter as outlining your flaws, you are not in danger of seeing me at all – I have been able to arrange with Sotheby's to have the Yates Thompsonsale</p>
