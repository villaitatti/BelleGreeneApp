<p>Dear B.B. –</p>
<p>I arrived too late and too exhausted last evening to even write but a telegram to you.</p>
<p>This hotel was and <u>is</u> crowded and all they could [^only^] give me was somebody's salon with absolutely <u>no</u> conveniences –</p>
<p>I was really indecently</p>
<p>dirty from 2 days on the train, but rather than tackle the <u>one</u> public bath, I fell into bed <u>as was.</u> </p>
<p>Now as to my engagements – I know only two or three people here, outside of His Holiness! & the Vatican people – I am making no personal engagements until I see how much time I must give there</p>
