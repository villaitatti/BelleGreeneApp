<p>visitors that I turn a deaf ear and a stone heart to literally <u>hundreds</u> who ask me to give them a letter to you – [<i>triple underlined:</i> but<u>]</u> – I promise by all that is in me – to rend you limb from limb, smite you, <u>hip</u> and <u>thigh</u> , if you are not divine, adorable, fascinating, enchanting, Hellishly flirtatious with Ethel McGibbon – It is not every day you get the likes of her, although she is no longer beautiful –</p>
<p>And – <u>trust thou me</u> for arriving after the 12 July – Tell Nicky that she has had your undiluted society (God help her) and undivided attention (angels and archangels preserve her) for long enough – so I shall probably bring along some male specimen to ‘divart her attention’ from you while I am there – Poor dear to have that Trevy hang his eyes on her – Just 1 day (in Paris) was enough to put <u>me</u> off him for life – I’d rather subsist on gruel (the watery kind) only, for the rest of my life – He – ‘it’– is a Total irredeemable <u>Loss</u>!!</p>
<p>Why don’t you & Nicky motor about with me the last 2 weeks in July – we might do Venice –</p>
