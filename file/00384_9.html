<p>that –</p>
<p>Jack Morgan expects to go to England on Saturday for a month but may not do so at the last moment – while he is away, I shall have to negotiate sale of the 18th century things and I think that is all we will attempt this season – there is no doubt that Duveen will buy them – Its [sic] only a question of haggling over the price – they are now removing the Chinese Porcelains from the museum – </p>
<p>I wish you could see some of the fine Oriental things that are being offered over here – all the Armenian dealers are here – Yamanaka has 2 Chinese heads I am <u>dying</u> for – but I might as well think of the moon as he wants $5000 – Each – He has a splendid stone Kuan-Yin (small) for $3000 – and some [<i>triple underlined: </i>fine] Han tiles which I believe the Cleveland Museum has bought – Bourgeois has an early jade this shape [<i>sketch of a cylinder</i>] perfectly plain, almost as big as <u>my</u> jade </p>
