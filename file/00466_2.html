<p>memory – a memory which one is glad to keep and which (unless pushed!!) does not intrude itself into your hourly life as you live it from day to day –</p>
<p>Believe me, you Dear, I'm not <u>saying</u> these things – I'm just thinking them out loud as I go along – so don't be impatient or cross just yet –</p>
<p>As you know I do not make the slightest move to bring myself into your active living not even here in New York as I so easily could – because I have a hunch that it is not <u>me</u> – primarily –that you <s>want</s> [^need^], but the rush & wear & tear, the things & people that must be crowded in – for the next 7 years!</p>
