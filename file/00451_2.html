<p>popped up here which will <u>necessitate</u> my returning here by May 5 or 6th –</p>
<p>As I must be in Paris at least one week to wind up my affairs there, and as I <u>must</u> sail for home on May 12th – I am only left about 2 weeks in Rome.</p>
<p>I want to see just as much of you as I <u>possibly</u> can – but you are to decide how much and where.</p>
<p>If you can stand the journey to Rome why not plan to come down there about the 19th and let me go back to Settignano (or I can <u>easily</u> put up at the hotêl in Florence) for Saturday & Sunday the 24 & 25 – I only make this as a suggestion –</p>
<p>I want very much to go to Monte Cassino & Siena – Are they very far – from you – or from Rome? –</p>
<p>Make your plans and I will do everything I can to meet them consistent with the work at the Vatican – Do get well – Bestest</p>
<p>Ever Your</p>
<p>Belle</p>
