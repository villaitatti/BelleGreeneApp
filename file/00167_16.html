<p>supposed find of 50 Coptic manuscripts containing purely Byzantine illuminations, of which I have heard through Arthur Sambon of Paris â€“ You must keep this Strictly confidential asno oneelse is supposed to know of the collection.</p>
<p>The collection contains 26 complete books of the Bible among other things. He sent me photographs of some of the illuminations which excite my interest more than I can say</p>
<p>I have made him an offer, contingent of course, to this being satisfactory</p>
