<p>Slide, or fall – with-a-thud.</p>
<p>I honestly, truly, hope-I-may-die & X-my-heart, ask only for a soothing oblivion and anonymity.</p>
<p>I would to God my name were anything but "Belle Greene"</p>
<p>Love is not worth a sigh</p>
<p>And I have done with fame,</p>
<p>Dig for me where I lie</p>
<p>A grave Without a name.</p>
<p>Yours – till we scrap again,</p>
<p>Belle</p>
