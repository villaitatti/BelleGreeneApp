<p>co-operation of an Advisory Council of six men, selected from the Art Departments of Harvard and Princeton. “Yours truly” to help at the mechanical end. I felt that they would all be better off without me, but they very flatteringly insisted upon my inclusion.</p>
<p>I have been kept incessantly busy at every waking moment, and so have not been able to write any letters except purely business ones – but I am “consecrating” an evening next week for a real letter to you.</p>
<p>[ <i>Handwritten</i> : Ever Yours,</p>
<p> <u>Belle]</u> </p>
