<p>personally a nice & likeable young child, – andAgroaof Denmark – but if I can’t do that, I’ll get some people to meet him at luncheon or dinner the following week – Its too bad that he’s cursed with that name as he appears sweetly Fauntleroyish & of course the name raises high hopes –</p>
<p>Well Darlint – you must admit this is over-longish. I hope your health improves – but I don’t see howinhell it can – under all the circumstances –</p>
<p>LUV to you</p>
