<p>letters. Nothing disagreeable has happened but several delicately stimulating encounters – In any case she is sailing on the first of August – Evelyn Benson writes me that 2 of her devilishly & unnecessarily-good-looking sons are marrying – The eldest to Lady Elcho (dau. of the Duke of Rutland) & the youngest to Lord Dudley’s daughter – </p>
<p>I met the Memyss lady when I was staying with the Holfords and thought her altogether charming – Mrs. B. spared me no details and is evidently preening herself – She’s a great little manager & I do not doubt will marry her remaining daughter off to the Prince of Wales or the Duke of York – Dear B.B. – a goodnight kiss to you – <u>Belle</u></p>
<p>P.S. (<u>Confidential</u>) I advise you to <u>keep an eye on Offner and be careful what you say to him</u> – It’s fine of Sachs to give him the fellowship, isn’t it –</p>
