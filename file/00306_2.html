<p>was a Dr. Sarthoiu [sic] and his wife, the latter a sister of Jean de Mot, one of the directors of the Brusselles Gallery, whom I know slightly. He gave her a long and amusing letter of introduction to me in which he said that he has heard that I am <u>enamoured of Chinese Art</u> !! and he approves although he hopes it will not turn my interest aside from the fine stuff in European Art – Now how do you suppose that way off in Bruxelles he heard that – I lunched with her and some others – there were so many I did not attempt to learn their names – The men amusingly took my temperature and all sorts of things and prophesied that I was going at too high a rate of nervous energy and ought to go to all their various homes for a complete rest and change – I was due at a big dinner given to Gertrude Atherton, but was so exhausted that I could only sink into bed – where I have been for two hours and only got up to write this. So goodnight now dearest – Belle</p>
