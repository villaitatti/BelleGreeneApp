<p>the greatest actress I have ever seen and she is also intensely interesting to talk with. She told me that she had lived in a lunatic asylum for a short time while studying the role of Elektra. Von Wahrlich sang for us later. His voice is very full, very intense and very appealing – and made me wish that you were somewhere <u>within reach</u> . I wanted to touch you and to feel you near me – Then I went up to Mrs. C.</p>

<p>B. Alexander’s, where my French professor, “Count” Wierzbicki was giving a Pelléas & Mélisande recital. He read the text and Miss Lillie Lang Collins played – of course you have heard the opera so you know how beautiful the music is. I <u>adore</u> it. The sound of the wind in the trees water rippling along over stones & lapping the edge of the stream the faint call of far away birds the perfume of the flowers & the kiss of the sun – It is transporting.</p>
