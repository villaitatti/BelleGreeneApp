<p>(there has been a ‘taxi’ strike for three days – also porters, etc)</p>
<p>Lo and behold when the time came, they calmly said that they had <u>not</u> been able to obtain anything! By sheer grace of God, a lone taxi drove up to deposit some official – I grabbed him and covered him with money to take me and my maid & luggage to the boat</p>
<p>Trevelyan came along then to say goodbye and was really a <u>dear</u> , insisting upon going to the station with me and helping with the luggage as he knew there were no porters to be had – When you see him or write him do tell him that I shall not soon forget his kindness. He did everything he could to make me comfortable – He is really <u>not</u> so bad as you all paint him – because he took me to dinner one night and would have taken me to</p>
