<p>I heard various versions of the tale until Sully (the dealer) came in the other day & said he hadlunchedthe previous Sunday with the Wideners & Mrs. George had told him the following story – that the Customs people had found, among Duveen’s papers here a <u>letter</u> from the London house to the New York house sayingthe <s>re</s> ywere sending the drawings (I <u>believe</u> in a drawer of a cabinet) and that they were to be gotten through the customs import being declared <u>at all</u> & to be delivered to Mrs. W. – so she had to give up the drawings & is now, not only willing but anxious, to pay all the duty so as to avoid trouble. I have not heard <u>definitely</u> about Altman but understand that in his case the government accuse him of <u>connivance</u> with Duveen – They also took some of Charles Taft’s (brother to the President) things & he is <u>very</u> nervous – They have not been [ <i>double underlined</i> : near] us as yet – I had to stop here to knock on wood –</p>
