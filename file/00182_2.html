<p>I am sorry you bothered to return that other photograph – I sent some to my brother Russell & his wife who live in Florida at the same time I mailed yours & evidently got one of his in by mistake</p>
<p>Did you <u>also</u> get one of the kind you returned or perhaps that was one you did not care for – I saw the de Meyer proofs yesterday they are interesting specimens of photography and like me as I am <u>sometimes</u> but as you have not very often seen me so you may not like them. However</p>
