<p>a cold – nothing at all serious – but there is so much "flue" here that I do not want to take any chances – </p>
<p>You can write me here until (letter to reach me) May 1st – after that Morgan Grenfell & Co – Old Broad Street London or Claridges – but Morgan Grenfell will be safer as I may go to the Holfords immediately upon landing for a week or so – I quite fell in love with both of them when I was last in London & they want me to stay with them all the time I am in London – but <u>believe you me</u> it's far too restricting.</p>
