<p>stingy & cruel of you for you must know that I am up to my ears from early morn ‘till early morn, in truth it is only the greatest exercise of will power that makes me write up my diary every day. How I long to see you tonight – How I wish that I were to go out now & find you secreted in a dark corner of the car and then the joy of cancelling all engagements & carrying you home</p>

<p>with me – Instead I am to dine with a most exacting & energetic man – John Cosgrove Editor of Everybody’s (which you never heard of!) & afterwards we go to see Ruth St. Denis then tomorrow I go up to Tuxedo to Mrs. Hamilton the only female in the family whom I really love – I shall think of you <u>all</u> day there. Goodnight dear – I shall shut you in my heart & lock the door & throw <u>all</u> the bolts – I kiss you until my breath leaves me & my body melts into yours Belle </p>
