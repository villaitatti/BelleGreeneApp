<p>before I get through with him – <u>but</u> –that’s as far as I can go – No ‘counting the world well lost’ and all that stupid rigamorale for mine – <u>besides</u> –‘my bonnie lies over the ocean’ etc!</p>
<p>Good night B.B dear – You know better than all your attendant females – whether I’m worth your still luvvin’ a wee bit or not –</p>
<p>We knock the bloody blocks offer anyone who says a word agin you – (not that many do – only an occasional jellius yeller dawg)</p>
<p>Martha Hyde & I did the anvil chorus over d’Hendicourts bleeding corpse, for you the other day – at a luncheon of 8 – until he begged for mercy on his knees –  just the same he’s very nice in his own way – but we don’t like <u>fleas</u> – worrying a <u>lion</u> –</p>
<p>So there!</p>
<p>Luv, <u>Belle</u> </p>
