<p>Daarrling BB –</p>
<p>I meant to write you a nice long letter last night from Ardsley but I was not left alone a single minute. I had to play golf (which I don’t like) all afternoon and I was pretty tired by tea time and then had to sit up</p>
<p>and listen to a lot of very young men tell me how wonderful I was – and to see them cast longing eyes at a very blond & very pretty widow whom they did not know – but I did & soon called her over, introduced every one of the callow youths and made an excuse & went in to rest a bit after dinner then motored home in the moonlight</p>
