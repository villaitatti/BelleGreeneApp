<p>said howdydo & walked on while he was still talking to me or rather at me – Worch said that he had brought all the society dames in – <u>but</u> – <u>that</u> not one had bought anything. Vigoureux told me that it was <u>Jaccaci</u> who had bought the Sung portrait and <u>not</u> the Metropolitan Museum – but I understand that Jaccaci is to offer it to the Museum – I think it is awfully amusing the way Jaccaci seems to be <u>instructing</u> female society in art – I hope it pays him well other than in social prestige, for it certainly must be somewhat boresome and humiliating. When I got back to the Library I found a man from Kelekian awaiting me with a page from De Motte’s Shah volume, of which you have several you said. I rather liked it but not overmuch and not enough to buy. I have never seen the book or any other leaves from it, but this certainly must have been one of the poorer leaves, for it was by no means <s>very</s> fine. He wanted $4000 for it but I should not have purchased it for 2000 – After this man several others came on business but I managed to get rid</p>
