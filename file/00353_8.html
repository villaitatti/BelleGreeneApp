<p>wooly and underbred creative here, Winifred Holt (daughter of the publisher) and that has given her a slightly bad eye. One hears absolutely <u>nothing</u> of her husband so I am wondering if he came with her – If so he may have gone direct to Washington. I don’t think she will realize her ambition of raising one million dollars – Everyone <u>I</u> asked (since she came) turned me down on the plea of having</p>
<p>already contributed and being too poor to do anything more – I <u>do</u> hope that for your sake I shall be able to do something for her – I shall keep on trying however – now I must run – I had been waiting for Junius Morgan who came to say goodbye to me & he is now here –</p>
<p>All my love. your <u>dear</u> </p>
<p> <u>Your</u>  <u>Belle</u> </p>
