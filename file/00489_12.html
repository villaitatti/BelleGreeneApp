<p>They said they would be delighted to allow me to have the picture down and the plates made, <u>if</u> they were for <u>myself</u> or for Mr. Morgan – so I simply had to lie outright & say they were for me, as of course J.

Otherwise I will be in Dutch with them forever –</p>
<p><u>Yours of May 18</u> – If Porter comes to see me, I shall be delighted to know him – I cannot run after him – also, I’m not long</p>
