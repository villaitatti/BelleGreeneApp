<p> <u>never</u> works out when you go to the bank for your money –</p>
<p>Of course I am pretty sure that all the prices asked of me are for <u>Americans</u> – but I do not know Paris well enough to shop otherwise. This hotel asks me 200 francs a day for my apartment & of course extra for any maid & the meals – Even although J.P. <u>is</u> paying for it, it makes me uncomfortable – I am going to look out for a cheaper one for my return. Someone told me to try the Hotel Vouillemont – do you know that?</p>
<p>My address in London will be the Curzon Hotel on Curzon Street, although Morgan Grenfell, 82 Old Bond Street, will always forward mail & I presume is a bit safer –</p>
<p>I do wish you were going to</p>
