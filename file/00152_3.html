<p>yesterday – I don’t know why but she seemed to avoid it – except that she did say that you both agreed on the subject of cigarettes (I had been smoking by the way <u>all</u> the time she was talking) </p>
<p>I <u>really</u> had to laugh – none can reform me but myself and I am</p>
<p>[p. 6]</p>
<p>doing it, but by degrees – I think the cigarettes will be the last things on the list to go so don’t bother your adorable head about them any longer – </p>
<p>Please write me at once about your health – how you slept – your appetite and every thing in connection with it – Give my dear love to Mary and please hug & kiss yourself for me – I shall love you forever B. B. daarrling – Your Belle –</p>
