<p>Tuesday – Oct. <u>5.</u> 1909</p>
<p>Dear –</p>
<p>I have your short but welcome letter of the <s>17th</s> ˆ23dˆ – from Paris – and I wish this were going to you in London – much as you dislike it – rather than Italy – that most enchanting country is so hopelessly far away – so far that I can with difficulty find you and it</p>
<p>makes me feel that you are slipping away from me which I do not like at all – How I wish you were here & to be here at least for the winter? I want to see you & talk to you & feel you near me & get in touch with you once more. I do not know <u>why</u> it is – that you seem so <u>vague</u> & distant – perhaps because my life has been so unusually crowded this</p>
