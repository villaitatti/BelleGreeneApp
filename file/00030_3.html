<p>did enjoy the yachting however – there was a large number of yachts out & we paid several visits.

<p>would be able to understand my consternation if you knew just what this news meant – namely that I was to set the thousand and one wheels of the machinery of “perfect readiness” going – so that perforce I gave up the trip to the White Mountains –</p>
<p>I was glad to learn from your cable that you had seen the Big Chief – I envy you – –</p>
<p>I had a cable from my dear Charles Lanier</p>
