<p>You know him (at least he knows <u>you</u> ) & some time you must tell me how they get that way before puberty –</p>
<p>Sybil Colefax told me that you were going to Greece with Mrs. Kahn et al – Are you really, and when? Miss Thurston is going there – sailing on the 3d of April to ‘dedicate’ the Gennadius Library –That of course is only an excuse for her to ‘do’ Greece . If you are going to be there at all when she is, won’t you tote her around just once or twice? She is about as gosh awfully ignorant in some ways as anyone I have ever known – but in others she is fairly intelligent – and when you <u>are</u> [ <i>double underlined</i> :nice] (or when she knows I’m “loving you again”) she really likes you awfully – Ennyhow, me Lamb, <u>do</u> sit yourself down & write her a short note, saying I have written you that she’s going to furrin’ parts and ask her to “call” at I Tatti – She probably is not going to Italy at all – so you won't be letting yourself in for anything – but it will at least show her that I've notified the world of her arrival – It's going to be <u>awfully</u> hard to give her letters for France & England (thank God I don’t know a soul in Greece) because the people who give me a good time there (aside from collectors and museumers) just don’t know what to do with her type – or she with them – I daresay that I can keep her busy between the art and the book world there – as some of these, like Cockerell, Hind, Kenyon etc, are rather dear & will put themselves to some inconvenience for me – Poor thing – she hasn’t been over for years – and she increasingly feels her subordinance to me in the Library – That, I can do nothing about, because she does not go ahead & I have to increasingly supervise everything she does – and <u>especially says</u> – as she makes some awful verbal blunders – Nuff sed –</p>
