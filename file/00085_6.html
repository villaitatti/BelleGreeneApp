<p>time to answer all your questions now or to either assent or disagree to all the things you propose – the Louvre, Cluny & the Moreau I <u>must</u> do if I do nothing else – I should like to see Dreyfus & Bing but I won’t promise to do any more as there are lots of other, perhaps unimportant, things I must do while in Paris & it looks now as if I should only be there three or four days at the most – of course I am crazy about Cha <s>r</s> tres (can’t spell it to save my life [ <i>quintuple underlined:</i> damn] this pen!) but I don’t believe we can give up all Sunday to it – Nous en parlerons plus tard–</p>
<p>Fry took me to see his Titian today. Whatever it is, Titian or not it is a charming picture, not <u>my</u> kind, but amiable – in fact for the subject (Judith with the head of Holofernes) the <u>most</u> amiable thing I have</p>
