<p> <u>P. S.</u> I find as I am about to close this that there are <u>millions</u> of things I have forgotten to say to you – <u>Firstly</u> my <u>general</u> cable address is [in secretarial script: Green <u>e</u> , Morgan New York] – be careful to put the final <u>E</u> on my name as there are others without the E and we often get confused – I have a private code which so far has been for my Boss’s use alone – If I find that he</p>
<p>has no objections (after I see him) I will send you that – as it is known to be <u>personal</u> – whereas if I am out of town <u>they</u> are apt to open the other – then I want to remind you that my address is [in secretarial script: <u>East</u> ] – as I have this afternoon received a letter – an <u>enchanting</u> letter – dated June 18 – but delayed in reaching me because you addressed it West – Don’t you know that the whole length of the social ladder lies between <u>East</u> and <u>West</u> 36th Street. If you are quite unable to remember that we consider that</p>
