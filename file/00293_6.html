<p>card for a lecture by Sirén on Leonardo – on April 3rd I do wish you were to be here I should insist upon your allowing me to go with you – Does he know such an awful lot?</p>
<p>You must tell me how the Raphael looks at Widener’s and if they have sense enough to put it in a room by itself – also tell me if you came across a lady I am very fond of in Philadelphia, Mrs. <u>John</u> Markoe – <u>I</u> think that she is a great person and would like to grow up to be like her – Now I must run. a long letter from Murray this morning in which he tells me how much he dreads the trip and everything connected with it &windsup by saying he will “throw himself on my mercy” – He’ll find it [^a^] pretty rough falling spot. I’m not going to get tied up with him if I can help it – a <u>beastly</u> rainy day & you nowhere man <u>except within</u> and I don’t feel any philosophical today Ever Your Belle</p>
