<p>going to have a very strenuous winter – I wrote to Mrs. Berenson on the boat I must admit it was not a very satisfactory epistle but I <u>do</u> like her so much that I wanted to write to her any how – Well dear I <u>must</u> stop – I do love you & you must & shall believe it – I miss you all the time very much & do wish I could see you if only for a moment. <u>Do</u> take care of your health for remember you belong to [ <i>triple underlined</i> : me] now – I kiss you dear lots & lots – I have lots of brand new love to add to the old for you – Devotedly <u>your</u> Belle</p>
