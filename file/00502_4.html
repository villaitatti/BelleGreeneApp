<p>the material –</p>
<p>I paid little attention to the collection other than the Oriental material – The Whistlers did not interest me much and I <u>loathed</u> the Peacock Room – In my poor opinion it’s the Cuspidor of the world – into which every peaceful lover of beauty must have spat – I could not say much however, as [^the^] Howard Mansfields, Kennedy & Peterson were with me and <u>they</u> all loved it.</p>
<p>It's heavenly up here – My rooms are in a tower and I sleep amongst tree tops with a purley [sic] Wagnerian bird chorus to wake me every morning – I am fairly intoxicated by the colours of the foliage – the stark warm black-brown of the tree trunks and the feathery leaf foliage – grey-green – yellow green and a swanky bottle green – with here and there the pink and white of dogwood and permeating it all the heady fragrance of lilacs and moist earth – The humans are only annoying and the only exercise my mind gets is in avoiding them as much as possible – I have just finished Paul Van Dyck’s Catherine de Médecis and daresay have annoyed him by writing that I think Elizabeth <u>far</u> [ <i>double underlined</i> : far] greater, and in all senses – particularly personally, more important –</p>
<p>I am sending you a little book – “Lady into Fox” one of the most exquisite and delicious bits of phantasy I have read for a long time – I won’t be able to <u>bear</u> it, if you don’t chortle with glee over it –</p>
<p>I hope to get out to India next year, but am not at all sure I can make it – I hear that you are or have been in Greece – I wonder if I shall ever accomplish that joy –</p>
<p>I still love the Lincoln Memorial, but I came away from Washington feeling that the Washington <u>Monument</u> was certainly the greatest <u>art object</u> in America. It gave me this trip, such a succession of thrills as I have never experienced in this country before – Hope all this has not bored you –</p>

<p>P.S – If you see Mr. Porter, as I am sure you have or will, will you thank him for me for the munificent gift of his 10 volumes, and say that I am waiting to write him, until I have finished the text? Meantime I am enjoying the volumes of reproductions <u>immensely</u> – Our poor frail Child – the ‘Art Studies’ magazine is coming out next month – It interests me less and less – but it is shameful that it should be so.</p>
<p>I hate having to go back to town next week “My sould [sic] is sick of the Highways of Seduction” – I long for a desert green island lost in the Pacific Ocean –</p>
