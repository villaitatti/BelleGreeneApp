<p> <u>Tuesday, April 29</u> </p>
<p>Dearest B. B.</p>
<p>Your last letter had a note of <u>tears</u> in it which has upset me a good deal and which has caused me much anxiety about you – I do not know that you were aware of it when you wrote, but I felt it very strongly on reading it. Your health does not seem to improve as it should under the</p>
<p>[p. 2]</p>
<p>wonderful conditions of sun and air and quiet in which you live and I am wondering if perhaps you ought not to get more away from yourself and with people you love and who love you – why not come over here for a while and let me take care of you? I think you need to be <u>loved</u> , B. B. dear, every minute of the day and night – and I am sure my love is not reaching you as I would want it</p>
