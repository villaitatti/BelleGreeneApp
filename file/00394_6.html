I am buying some quite modern Chinese rugs. I don't like them as you may know – but they have the color I want and of course I cannot afford the old ones – I certainly would like to be rich enough to have everything in my house real and I'm hoping to accomplish it bit by bit – </p>

<p>I am – always – your Belle.</p>
