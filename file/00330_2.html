<p><u>Sunday 21</u></p>
<p>life is horribly dull here – at least <u>I</u> feel dull – I had lots of invitations to go out of town this week end but did not feel in the mood and have been here (at the Library) all day – and have accomplished much that I set out to – mostly writing business letters which I hate. The way in which they accumulate is nothing short of monstrous. Almost everyone I know is abroad and I am positively aching</p>
<p>[p. 4]</p>
<p>for Paris – Agoness sends nothing but <u>pastels</u> so I return the correspondence in the same way – By the time you get this, I dare say she will be in London – I am enclosing an article about Johnson which may (or may not) interest you. I feel <u>frightfully</u> dull – So will go home to read Laufer’s book – I feel horribly lonely and blue. I suppose it’s my own fault. Wish you were here or I were there Ever Your Belle</p>
