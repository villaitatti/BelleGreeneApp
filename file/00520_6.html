<p>[p. 9]</p>
<p>want to do something for Omont, for undertaking the publication of our Dioscorides, and for all his great kindnesses to me and to the Library-</p>
<p>I have been off on 2 short trips- one to Beauvais, Amiens, Arras & so on to Boulogne then back by way of Le Touquet for a day on the nice warm sand and a night and half a day at Chantillly [sic] – and over this last weekend holiday (the Assumption) we went to Rouen and one or two neighboring places, and last night stayed at St. Germain at the Pavillon Henri IV – or rather in one of their small, <u>enchanting</u> 'honeymoon' pavillions – overlooking that divine landscape, with the wonderful straight road to Paris running from across the river –</p>
<p>It was a <u>too</u> heavenly night, with its new slender moon, and at 4:30 this morning I watched the sun creep up and change the world again in an hour or two – Now I shall just work</p>
