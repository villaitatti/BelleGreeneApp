<p>Lady Johnstone yesterday – I was delighted to find how calmly I was able to look on her charms (I used to be <u>quite</u> mad about her!) – She seems to have been through a terrible siege with her mother, whom she expects to live not more than 3 months. You remember I told you I was [illegible deletion] suspecting her <u>no. 2</u> qualities? Well she showed more of them yesterday and really <u>quite</u> embarrassed me! She has fallen off terribly in her looks and there is a sort of moral looseness about her face that makes me quite unhappy – But what a <u>magnificent</u> arrival she has been! She told me that she felt <u>very</u> strongly Read’s disapproval & dislike & that, much to her regret, it had the effect of making her reckless & “don’t care” and so being her worse [sic] self. I can quite imagine that – She is evidently quite intimate with Benson & adores Murray –</p>
