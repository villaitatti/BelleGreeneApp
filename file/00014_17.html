<p>on the envelope – My Boss adores it & I think it villainous & Jesuitical – here is a choice bit that John D.

<p>“A wise old owl sat in an oak –</p>
<p>The more he saw the less he spoke –</p>
<p>The less he spoke the more he heard</p>
<p>Why can’t I be like that wise old bird” –</p>
<p>J. D. R. –</p>
<p>C’est à rire n’est ce pas?</p>
<p>Je l’ai oublié depuis longtemps – Write me at once Belle</p>
