<p>A Glorious Easter to you B. B. dear you [ <i>double underlined:</i> are] a piggie never towrite me! I haven’t heard from you for <u>two</u> weeks now – but I will set you the example of <u>not</u> writing you and <u>not</u> intimating that you are running</p>
<p>after strange ladies! Today is enough to drive me <u>mad</u> it is so beautiful, so gorgeously flooded with <u>real</u> sun, so warm and so balmy. It is a revelation as to what real weather must be. and to us, who have been deluged by rain and gloom for weeks except for a stray day or two</p>
