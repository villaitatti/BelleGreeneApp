<p>procedure – I am sure that (granted they were dealing with a worthy opponent) that they go through the same series of antics until they break down his defense – but so far <u>at every point</u> I’ve frustrated them while seeming to work with them – I’ve lied to them twice, but they both lied to me a thousand times – <u>only</u> my two lies were more potent with them than all theirs with me –</p>
<p>One point in my favour is that they <u>know</u> I am making nothing out of the job they know also I like them and they know also that I like <u>you</u> – they don’t know that I’m willing to throw them over in a <u>minute</u> if they don’t <s>com</s> cough up the price – I’ve worked over them until one o’clock at night sometimes and two or three times a day – they started out to pay 2 millions and I won’t let it go for a <u>cent</u> under three and if they don’t buy I’ll sell it to another man and put them (<u>the Duveens</u>)</p>
