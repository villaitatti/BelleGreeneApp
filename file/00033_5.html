<p>I am <u>much</u> more anxious that <u>he</u> should like <u>you</u> than that you should like him – <s>I want you to</s> for many reasons – – </p>
<p>I have a letter from Fitz today in which he tells me of his ^recent^ contributions to the ˆSo. K.ˆ Museum, they must be quite important, especially the “Breton” facade – also that he has finally donated all his “Pâté poudre” as well as some of his other China – It gives him <u>so</u> much pleasure to patter around there that what matter if it bores every one else to tears? – He had a quite wonderful trip in the Corsair down the Dalmatian coast – I quite envied him –</p>
<p>Do you know old Salting at all? A</p>

<p>most curious creature – shadow of Fitz – & who in his own selfish way was extremely kind to me – He has several things I adore – but most of all a Holbein miniature of Anne of Cleves</p>
<p>Beloved, I found that, in my usual wild and scatter brained way, I sent you the <u>wrong</u> Laffan letter! – true to my southern birth and blood which has a firm belief in “signs and omens –” I concluded <s>in</s> the mistake was the hand of my Guardian angel (<u>masculine</u>!) and that I ought not to send you the Raphael one – I therefore destroyed it – However I shall see the gentleman “face to face” within a day or two and I will be able to write you the truth – or so much of it as he is capable of telling!</p>
