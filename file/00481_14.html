<p>all means <u>nothing</u> to me – The next time I go to Paris, I shall be in the way of meeting some of the scholars (the only people I <u>really</u> want to know) and a few people whom I am willing (n.b.) to know. I care less than nothing whether the others praise me, blame me or leave me severely alone – The more I hear and see of celebrities or notorieties the more I <u>long</u> to remain unknown and unnoticed, except by very few and no one can honestly say that <u>I</u> have ever moved one step to meet him or her – or to continue an acquaintance</p>
<p>If I knew any one more than casually, it is because they “chose” <u>me</u> – I make no</p>
