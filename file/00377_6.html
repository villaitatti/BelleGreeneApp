<p>friend of mine and can’t [^sell evidently^] <s>get along</s> without me – and I see no reason why I should put myself out <u>except</u> as a business arrangement. He also said that he understood that D. – would not buy an Italian picture except upon your recommendation – Now then, tell me in confidence what you can of this from the photograph – and if you think it’s any good – I’m rather hoping, I must admit, that you’ll send back word that even from the photograph you can see that it is <u>not</u> Antonello – also advise me if you think it wiser for me not to have <u>anything</u> to do with it. I have a feeling that this latter course would be better as I know absolutely <u>nothing</u> other than – why the pictures may not even <u>belong</u> </p>
