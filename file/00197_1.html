<p>Dear B. B. –</p>
<p>Such <u>glorious</u> weather as we are having –</p>
<p>I feel made over and 100 pounds lighter and hungry and thirsty for life and more life –</p>
<p>It makes me pure pagan such gloriously warm & brilliant days</p>
<p>[p. 2]</p>
<p>We suffered for over two weeks from rain, sleet & snow.</p>
<p>I try to run out into the country for two or three hours every day in my little car – generally known as the “Roadlouse” – but it <u>can</u> cover the ground believe me –</p>
<p>I am having a very interesting visit from Dr. Schwenke</p>
