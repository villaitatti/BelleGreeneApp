<p> <u>when</u> we would be there together again. I am wondering if you took the Kahn’s there. Think of that horrid woman having <u>your</u> society!</p>
<p>Ada Thurston rather worried me about your health yesterday. She</p>
<p>said that although you were bright and gay yet you looked as if a breath might blow you away – Daarrling are you <u>really</u> well and strong – Do please dear, write me at once on this point and don’t try to comfort me. Please tell me the bare facts.</p>
<p>I could not get Thursty to talk much about you</p>
