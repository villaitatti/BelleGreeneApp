<p>The Day <u>after</u> thank God!</p>
<p>Dear B. B. –</p>
<p>It is a mere breathing corpse that is writing to you today – To say that I am <u>exhausted</u> is to put it mildly – I went to bed at 3:30 a.m – on Christmas Eve and was up and on the job at 10 a. m – Christmas morning (it</p>
<p>32044150448702_039.jpg</p>
<p>seems so long ago I just cannot say yesterday)</p>
<p>Oh! B. B. more children! There were <u>17</u> of them, 5 belonging to the Lady who washes & irons for us – , 2 to the cook –</p>
<p>They were <u>so</u> adorably dirty and common – insisted upon calling me Teacher and</p>
<p>32044150448702_042.jpg</p>
<p>wanting every thing in the house – one of them cried his little eyes out because I would not give him the Chinese dog – and two of them could not be prevailed upon to go home so I tucked them in bed in my maid’s room & they were still sleeping</p>
<p>32044150448702_043.jpg</p>
<p>when I left this morning.</p>
<p>It is not a day for the grown ups at all – and precious little fun we get out of it compared to the joy and wonder and delight of those children. At any rate I’m glad of the time & money and backache it cost me to make them happy – seeing them</p>
<p>32044150448702_048.jpg</p>
<p>however, has put yet another burden on my back, for not one of them was properly or warmly clothed so I’m going to take as many as I can get into my car tomorrow and put them all in a cheap store & have them clothed <u>en bloc</u> . Isn’t it terrible</p>
<p>32044150448702_049.jpg</p>
<p>to have such poverty, not only in the world, but in your own family so to speak – I thank my beloved J.P. that I have enough money to keep those kiddies warm this winter.</p>
<p>Later 3 p.m –</p>
<p>It seems hopeless to try to write you – I was interrupted in writing the above</p>
<p>32044150448702_040.jpg</p>
<p>and have only just been able to return – not a minute have I had for luncheon – One thing I want to say right here – if you <u>do</u> want me to read your letters for Gods Sake put the picture of a little [ˆ(Chinese)ˆ] Wall on the paper instead of [ˆIsabella’sˆ] <s>her</s> name</p>
<p>32044150448702_041.jpg</p>
<p>or any news of her – I cannot imagine my beloved Boston with that creature on one’s back morning noon and night</p>
<p>It seems to me that after having seen her <u>collection</u> one has seen all that is worth while of <u>her</u> – but to have her to talk, walk eat & sleep with is too terrible a thought</p>
<p>32044150448702_046.jpg</p>
<p>I have had shoals of people here since I last wrote you – Seligmann amongst them raving at Mr. Jack etc etc and being raved <u>at</u> in return. It was hardly a dignified scene and rather disgusted me. Mr. Jack has a very strong aversion to Jews – as such – and is not tactful enough to hide it – at least</p>
<p>32044150448702_047.jpg</p>
<p>until his object is accomplished and so, to me, seems extremely stupid – But after all, they are his troubles, not mine –</p>
<p>By the way, George Blumenthal called me up (for the millionth time) this morning and among other things said he had had a letter from Mary saying she heard that they (the</p>
<p>32044150448702_044.jpg</p>
<p>B’s) were going to move to Europe & that Mary hoped to see them before they sailed!</p>
<p>He was concerned for fear I had not told you that Florrie was desperately ill – as Mary had not mentioned it in the letter. I told him I had already told you of Florrie’s illness</p>
<p>He tried to find out from me how you</p>
<p>32044150448702_045.jpg</p>
<p>and Mary felt toward them and I said that the only <u>un</u> friendliness I had ever noticed had been on their side –</p>
<p>If you feel that he is useful or desirable to you – or that it is worth while for some reason to be friends with them, you might write him a letter and tell him how sorry you are to hear</p>
<p>32044150448702_052.jpg</p>
<p>of Florrie’s illness – <u>But</u> – don’t do it on my advice. I don’t think they have very much use for you and I also think that as long as they are as thick with Seligmann as they now are, that they will never be <u>sincere</u> with you – & very possibly they would harm you (in an underhand way) if</p>
<p>32044150448702_053.jpg</p>
<p>it were in their power. As far as I am concerned, I gave George a pretty frank dressing down & I am about to return an extremely expensive present that he sent me from Cartier – a piece of the greatest impertinence in my opinion –</p>
<p>He knows that he cannot hurt me & he knows that in a few little ways it is</p>
<p>32044150448702_050.jpg</p>
<p>much to his advantage to be friends with me & to have me at his house – so as far as nasty gossip is concerned I am quite <u>sure</u> he is finished – Enough about that polecat – I am going to the kind of dinner I <u>really</u> enjoy tonight a number of book collectors (Van Dusen, Fred Halsey, Ingraham</p>
<p>32044150448702_051.jpg</p>
<p>etc!) and only two women Mrs. Riggs (Kate Douglas Wiggin) and myself. and each person will talk about the thing he knows some little of and so each will be happy –</p>
<p>Saturday night I go to Winthrop Ames Dress Rehearsal of Shaw’s Philanderer.And on Sunday I am going out to</p>
<p>32044150448702_056.jpg</p>
<p>Mt. Kisco to spend the day with my friend Agnes Meyer – you remember she is the one I wanted you to meet – they have the most <u>lovely</u> country place you can imagine almost a thousand acres of <u>real</u> woods and a big lake, farms, fields – Everything to make life adorable</p>
<p>32044150448702_057.jpg</p>
<p>then they had sense enough to leave the original house on the place & it is <u>too</u> lovely – about 150 years old & they have done nothing but add necessary things & fix up the plumbing and electric lights.</p>
<p>It’s really a most heavenly place & I love to go there. I shall</p>
<p>32044150448702_054.jpg</p>
<p>come back to town on Sunday afternoon as I have a dinner at night –</p>
<p>The whole troupe of Grandchildren have just come in and it is useless to write more as they are all clustered around my desk & all talking at once –</p>
<p>Junius Morgan (the one you met in Paris)</p>
<p>32044150448702_055.jpg</p>
<p>got in on Wednesday night & went direct to his home in Princeton. I am expecting him here tomorrow – You know I am <u>dreadfully</u> fond of him – he has his peculiarities but I am much devoted to him & he has been a good friend to me –</p>
<p>My friend, Mrs. Cadwalader Jones called up today asking if she might bring <u>your</u> friend</p>
<p>32044150448702_058.jpg</p>
<p>Mrs. Wharton to the Library – so she also has arrived.</p>
<p>I told Mary Jones, that they could come next week as I was too busy these two days – I shall be glad to meet the lady <u>here</u> for the first time. I can always be myself here and get a clearer feeling about people. Also when I am here</p>
<p>32044150448702_059.jpg</p>
<p>I am apt to be more polite & forgiving – Tomorrow the whole William James (Harvard) family are coming. I fear they will be dull –</p>
<p>I must rest now dear – I do <u>hope</u> this will catch you in your bath –</p>
<p>My love to your both –</p>
<p>Ever Yours</p>
<p> <u>Belle</u> </p>
