<p>is interested. I should be glad if you would call on her and will send you her address in a later letter but don’t put yourself out very much. <u>Especially</u> if you find you do not like her. She is <u>very</u> warm hearted and will be a great friend to you if she likes you <u>as</u>  <u>I</u>  <u>am</u> </p>
<p> <u>sure</u>  <u>she will</u> – Who indeed could help it?</p>
<p>I dined with John Lane last night He bored me dreadfully and got rather sentimental toward the end of the evening which disgusted me – Do you know him?</p>
