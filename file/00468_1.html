<p>Dear B.B. –</p>
<p>I won't enter into detailed comment of your two letters (received today) as we differ, rather widely, upon some of the people of whom you so enthusiastically write. Here's hoping that you are never disillusioned.</p>
<p>It all gives me further pause, however, in blindly accepting your verdicts –</p>
<p>I must admit that I had begun to "falter" somewhat earlier (no "cattishness" intended)</p>
