<p>Dearest B.B. –</p>
<p> <u>Really</u> I intended to write you regularly – but – everything here balks me – and now this can only be a line to thank you for your letter – I ‘whooped’ at your description of Rose Nichols, who had implored me to give her a letter to you – but she’s a good old Scout –</p>
<p>I’m hoping to get over early in June – I’ve given up Spain –</p>
