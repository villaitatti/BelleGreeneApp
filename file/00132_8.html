<p>is sailing then –</p>
<p> <u>Daarrling</u> I <u>want</u> you – I want to be in your arms, I want to sit by you as you work & read, I want to be with you when you walk or motor – when you see things & when you put your tired dear</p>
<p>sweet body to bed – I love you a million times more than I did a week ago – I kiss you & pat your cheek &[illegible]onyour hairs & close your eyes & kiss you again – Goodbye my dear true love – Don’t bother about the Black Ethel. Nothing can take me from you or you from my heart now –</p>
<p>[ <i>double underlined</i> : Your] <u>very one</u> Belle</p>
