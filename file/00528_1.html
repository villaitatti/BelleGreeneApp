<p>Dear B.B. – I am just off for a few days over Easter – glory-be-to-Gawd, in the country – but send this to thank you for your letter to Miss Thurston, which she highly appreciated – She is to stop at the Petit Palais in Athens – I do hope the poor old dear has a grand time – she is wise enough to be satisfied with so little, that I’m sure she will.</p>
<p>I’m taking your ‘Piero’ article in Art in A. ___ with me to read on the train – lucky me to have something by one of my pet people about one of my pet artists – your last letter was as ‘snooty’ as an early Chinese martyr – <u>How</u> do people get that way – Overdoses of female hand nursing I presume– still I’m awful fonduv yer-Belle</p>
