<p>world to me – just as I know that your eyes are the bluest – your lips the most kissable & your nose the <u>crinkliest</u> in the world – I am fixing up a tiny little apartment next to my mother’s to be all my <u>very</u> own & every time I put in a chair or place a book or hang a picture or lay a bedspread I say – [ <i>double underlined</i> : some] day – “Daarrling” will sit there – <u>some</u> day“Daarrling” will read that, someday “Daarrling” will look at that & say “no – it’s not Joshua Reynolds – its [sic] an Amico of Sassetta” –some day“Daarrling” will lie there in my arms & I in his – & at that point I stop for there is a thumping in my heart & a choking in my throat & I can hardly wait for the day – I who am <u>so impatient</u> & who must learn to be so patient – good night my Sore Heart – Belle</p>
