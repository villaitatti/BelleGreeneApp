<p>the dance at the club which did not amuse me over much as it was given over to debutants. The museum here has bought that perfectly <u>stunning</u> Kuan-yin from Yamanaka’s of which I wrote you and sent you photographs – They also bought the Lo-han, which does not look so good to me here as it did at Yamanaka’s – they have 2 fine new leads, but it was all so <u>crowded</u> tonight (I never saw such a jam <s>t</s> in my life) that I shall wait until after my visit tomorrow morning to tell you of it – Goodnight you dear – I’m frightfully sleepy –</p>
