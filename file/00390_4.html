<p>as to the publication of your “Art in America” articles in book form I think you have very happily “escaped” from Sherman – I never thought he was a good man for you away I remember rightly I told you so – now when it comes to someone else publishing it there are certain things I would have to know – First about the plates – Do they belong to you or to Sherman? Second – do you expect to receive any money at all from the book – what terms for instance did you make with Lane & Putnams for your other books? Who has the manuscript and how many copies do you want printed? I should think it would be a nifty idea to have 2 editions – one more or <u>less</u> “deluxe” selling for say $10 or $15 and an ordinary edition for $2 or $2.50 <u>Do</u> inform me on all these points and I will get busy at once on a publisher</p>
