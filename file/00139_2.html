<p>to tell you and you write so well and so interestingly. Nothing at all is happening here – I think I told you that the Doctor said I must stopevery thingand become acquainted with my bedo’nights so I have not gone out <u>one</u> night this week so far and am not going out until Saturday when I am going to</p>
<p>hear or rather <u>see</u> Mary Garden in Thaïs – There was a lovely little verse in the Sun about her the other day</p>
<p>“We love little Mary –</p>
<p>Her art is so <u>warm</u> </p>
<p>And if you don’t <u>hear</u> her</p>
<p>She’ll do you no harm” –</p>
<p>It made her very cross but I had to chortle – I <u>adore</u> Thaïs and never miss a performance – I did not go to the Jongleur, Tuesday</p>
