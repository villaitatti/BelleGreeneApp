<p>Wednesday <u>Feb. 23 –</u> 1916</p>
<p>Dearest B.B. –</p>
<p> <u>Xcuse</u> the paper please. All the rest is so thick & makes such a bulky package I am sure the Censor would not let it through. I received <u>only</u> today your letter of Feb. 3 in which you say you are going to Rome so I dare say my cable has not reached you. I am glad you are going to have a change – I am sure you must need it and your letters have been so adorable & sweet lately that I am afraid you are seriously ill, or else seriously well – I hope you don't recover quickly whichever it is.</p>
<p>I am be-Fogged by Forbes (as you once so aptly put it) this morning so forgive me if this letter is somewhat incoherent. He sits mooning around and almost drives me mad – He has brought Sachs with him – a nice fat</p>
