<p>I am <u>not</u> in a letter writing mood as you can see so I’m not going to afflict you with much more of this sad stuff – I have not yet received the further photographs of your paintings I am <u>dying</u> to see them –</p>
<p>Love – Beloved – I <u>love</u> you I could crush you with love were you here. instead</p>
<p>I breathe all sorts of blessings upon your head and pray the dear Gods to bring me to you soon – You are the joy of my Existence here and I’ll hope of my pardon hereafter – [ <i>double underlined</i> : Belle]</p>
