<p>a million times for your dear comforting letter of the 13 – I shall fear nothing – Even the future & shall go on loving you to my heart’s content. It is such a <u>joy</u> to love you – it fills me with a blessed peace – that is at the same time exaltée – I feel as if I were walking on air most of the time and am <u>so</u> happy – I am so sure of <u>us both</u> – That’s where</p>

The fact is I am <u>really so</u> happy in</p>
