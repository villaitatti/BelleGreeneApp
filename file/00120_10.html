<p>cross because Pollock, Bispham & I could & would not dine with her tonight but they were both engaged for dinner at the Robinson-Smith’s where I went – Tomorrow Pollock is going to take her to the dress rehearsal of Hammerstein’s new comic opera & in the evening I have gotten up a party for Madame Butterfly – The Grants</p>
<p>the Oliver Herford’s, Pollock, Frank Gould, & Victor Harris – Tuesday night we go to Percy Mackaye’s premiere of his Scarecrow & Wednesday – oh! Most hallowed day, I see her off in the Lusitania at 9 a.m. – that night we are going to hold a “wake” over her ashes & it will be some party I assure you – I am a bit</p>
