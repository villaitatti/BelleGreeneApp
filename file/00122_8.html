<p>Isn’t it funny about Mrs. Lydig & my dear, even after all the snubs J. P. gave them they tried again – asked him to supper one night this week – and <u>I</u> as usual had to write & politely but firmly decline – I do <u>hope</u> she will take the hint this time and not put me to that nuisance again – I’m <u>dreadfully</u> afraid she will think it all my fault, by Heaven is [sic] witness I <u>tried</u></p>

<p>my best to make J. P. see her at the Library but he simply cannot stand her – says she’s empty headed & thin & doesn’t wear enough clothes – I hope to high Heaven that none of the “talk” Elsie de Wolfe writes you of will reach him – it will make an awful mess for us if it does as he thinks I’m his personal property & doesn’t like me Even to talk to another man – He asked me tonight</p>
