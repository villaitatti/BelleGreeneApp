<p>want to nip any such notion in the bud –</p>
<p>We are planning a very full and complete catalogue and in that Catalogue, I want you to "do" the pictures – You can have as much space as you like and I can arrange for you to have access to the MSS at the Vatican – Dr. Hyvernat is sailing for Rome on the 11 October to be gone about a year, to get the photographing etc. of them finished up – If you are going to be at Settignano this winter I'll tell Hyvernat to go up & see you – He is a French Catholic – a perfect old <u>dear</u> and I'm sure you'll enjoy talking to him –</p>
<p>Will you let me know how you feel about taking over this part of our later Catalogue? I think you will have a chance to do a full piece of work – for of course – its not only a description of the pictures we want – but a disquisition in <u>your</u> style of the subject of Coptic art in its relation to other countries etc.</p>
