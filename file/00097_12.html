<p>Madonna di Loreto – It is a medium sized square canvas – with a dark green curtain background – the Madonna robed in red is standing beside a white couch on which the child is lying on his back, looking up in her face – She isdrawinga very fine veil from his face – Joseph (?) is standing at the right clothed in brown – I am just giving you this careless description in case you can identify it by that. I really like it <u>immensely</u> – The coloring is exquisite. In spite of all</p>

<p>this enthusiasm on my part you may think it <u>punk</u> but I really don’t see how you could – They are having an exhibition of oriental rugs at the Museum, which I shall go to see & write you of – I am going to take Read to see the Altman, Frick & Havemeyer things next week – I am a bit curious to know what Altman will say of the Duveen matter.</p>
<p>The weather here is <u>divine</u> dazzling sunshine & just comfortably cool – I fear I am</p>
