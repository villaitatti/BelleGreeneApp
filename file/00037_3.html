<p>diet and relinquishment of professional cares. I am convinced that he has come back to die.</p>
<p>I wish you would not bother your head puzzling over why I like you. Pour l’amour de Dieu accept the fact while it is a fact – when it is no longer one it will be of little or no interest to either of us and so will neither suggest nor demand analysis – You say you are “bald & middle-aged” That may be true – I didn’t notice – But I did notice that you have a most enchanting fashion of wrinkling your nose. If you must have a reason for my present state of mind toward you nurse that one! –</p>
<p>I am going off on the Corsair for dinner tonight – and as there is a certain prospect of “bridge later” I am not madly in love with the idea. But it will please my Boss & surely I am able to do so little that gives him pleasure. He is the most exhausting person I know. He often tell me he “likes my personality” and yet when I leave him I feel utterly divested of it – as of a glove one draws off & gives to a friend because he admires it – As you know nothing whatever of Mrs. Truesdale I am not carried away by your opinion. She is restful & lovable & I don’t ask more of her – There are plenty of people who have brains & a purpose – Am I not a stupid stubborn heathen? – But don’t you care – I don’t. B.</p>
