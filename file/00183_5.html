<p>me to see the exaggerated idea of my influence with J.P. that Seligmann has. He seems to think all I have to do is to speak – I’ve told himan hundredtimes that it is not so but you can’t convince him. Of course it may be a play to the gallery and I take that view of the case in consideration when talking to him. He looks and seems <u>very</u> well and is going to “play” only over here ( <u>he</u> says!)</p>
<p>Rey told me so <u>many</u> nice things about you the other day</p>
