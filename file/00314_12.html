<p>But the great surprise he had for me was half a dozen [ <i>double underlined</i> : very] interesting Chinese paintings – One delightful mountainous landscape, seen under mist, he attributed to Ma-Yuan, but I imagine you would not. Then he had a <u>very</u> interesting small portrait of a priest, a fine kakemono with 2 white & feathery swans and a delightful makemono showing the shore of a river.

He also had a charming little stone Kwan-yin, about the height of one’s hand and an Indian goddess of some kind about a foot high – Besides all this, he has the finest collection of <u>modern</u> books I ever saw or ever hope to see – All first editions, most of them</p>
