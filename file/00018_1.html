<p>Wednesday – May 4 –</p>
<p>My dear old nurse – Who has been with me ever since I first opened my eyes upon this fascinating world – came to me in great excitement today with</p>
<p>the enclosed which she found in some shop and which she declares is a <u>speaking</u>  <u>likeness</u> of myself at five! It occurred to me that it might amuse you as it did me – I am going to visit some friends who are stopping at Atlantic City – tomorrow to stay until Monday and will write you from there</p>
