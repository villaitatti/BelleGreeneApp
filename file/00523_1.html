<p>Dear B.B – I am disgusted with myself – for in my desk drawer today I found a letter which I thought I had posted to you 2 weeks ago – all about Vienna & the MSS. there – I suppose you saw then all the great Dioscorides and the Genesis – the Karl the Great Gospels & all – I really envy you –</p>
<p>I received your letter about the de Couden – Kahn – people & asked them to a rather nice dinner party I gave on Tuesday but they were leaving on Monday night for Washington, and then going to Boston & other places. So I have invited them for the first night of their return and have got some amusing men for her & 1 or 2 <u>very</u> pretty smart girls for him & 1 or 2 amusing ones </p>
