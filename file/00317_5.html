Well said Read you would do all in your power to make the people who <u>dis</u> like him, like him – you would not divide your friendships, for and <u>against</u> Berenson, but you would try to bring them all together and <u>that</u> he said, you are one of the few women to do – Now I want you to go up to the Farm and I <u>promise</u> you that I will take charge and will allow nothing unfair</p>
<p>or underhand – I rather think I can manage Agnes and Eugene will help me and I think we will all come to a better understanding, etc. etc. The result was that I agreed to motor up on Sunday. He wanted me to take Murray & Raphael with me but I <u>absolutely</u>  <u>refused</u> to take Murray so our compromise on Raphael, that I will go up tomorrow with him in time for luncheon and leave in the afternoon so more tomorrow night about that – <u>Now</u> , I must tell you about the afternoon with Murray. I lunched with Raphael & at Sherry's</p>
