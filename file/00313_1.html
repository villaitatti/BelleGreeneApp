<p>Monday 3 p.m. Apr. 27</p>
<p>You darling B.B. – I don’t think I have missed you as much since you left as I have yesterday and today – You were continuously and uninterruptedly in my mind and I longed for your physical presence as I had not before – I <u>do</u> wish we could be together more. Last night I went to dine with the Stanwood Menken’s to meet my old friend Marie Van Saanen-Algi – There were shoals of people and I sat next to the gay & festive James Gayley whom I despise – More</p>
<p>people came in after dinner and danced – I went home early but could not sleep so finished the <u>Baber</u> memoirs</p>
<p> <u>What</u> a heavenly book – I should like to find a similar one on Akbar – do you know of any</p>
<p>Lunched with Thursty at the Woman’s University Club and was bored to tears – all the women talked <u>at</u> me until I was dizzy and they were all so plain and so badly dressed and radiated “purpose” so shamelessly –</p>
<p>I am feeling so blue and lonely for you that I don’t</p>
