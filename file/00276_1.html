<p> <u>Sunday Evening</u> </p>
<p>B.B. dear –</p>
<p>Here I am – at the beginning of the Retreat – for I havecancelledmy dinner engagement for tonight and am planning a delightful time with the Marteau & Vevercatalogue of the (Paris) Persian exhibition – I am sure that I am going to love</p>
<p>my Retreat – but I dare say only because I have been feeling the necessity of it for so long –</p>
<p>I must admit that I <u>cursed</u> when called at nine o’clock this morning, I was saturated with sleep and loved that bed as I never expect to love a mortal man – then too my first waking thought</p>
