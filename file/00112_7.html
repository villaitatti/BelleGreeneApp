<p>Enamels in St. Petersburg I can’t spell the man’s name to save my neck but the Catalogue of it published some years ago is <u>wonderful</u> – and my dear J. P. has all but promised me he will bring it over to America. I am <u>wild</u> to see it – He is leaving on the 11th for Egypt – How I wish you and I were going also –</p>
<p>Daarrling <u>where</u> shall we go this year? If I can come over it will not be</p>
<p>[p. 11]</p>
<p>until about the 1st of August & I can probably only stay a month – that is from about August 8 to Sept. 15 & be back here by the end of September.</p>
<p><u>What shall we do</u>?</p>
<p>I don’t like the idea of your coming to America <u>just now</u> for several reasons – just because of all of the Customs rows & I fear they would get wind of your coming & try to get you to testify for them</p>
