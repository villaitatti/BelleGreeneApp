<p>the Laufer & the sculpture books look <u>tremendously</u> interesting. Daarrling, if I could be with you, <u>live</u> with you for even a year, I <u>know</u> I would amount to something, but it is so difficult away off here alone –</p>
<p>Yes, I fear I shall not be able to come over</p>
<p>[p. 6]</p>
<p>until late October – to stay for the Huth sale –</p>
<p>What I would really like would be to come to you at I Tatti until time to go to London for the sale (probably November 4) I doubt if I can be away longer than 6 weeks including the 2 weeks of voyage</p>
<p>This promises to be an appallingly busy year for J. P. and I feel that</p>
