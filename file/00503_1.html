<p>Dear B.B. –</p>
<p>I really did hope to get a Christmas line to you or failing that a word for the New Year, but I never seem to have a free or quiet moment – My unanswered correspondence hangs like the old man of the sea about my shoulders and has reached a point at which excuses are futile – </p>
<p>I am glad you liked our MS. which Cockerell & Co. are to publish for the Roxburghe</p>
