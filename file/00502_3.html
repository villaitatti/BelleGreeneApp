<p>A chün-yao bowl over which Freer and I had struggled for possession! – I would not give $500 –for it today – in fact, would not want it any more than a piece of delicately coloured Rookwood pottery for the one and only purpose of holding flowers – but at the time it was glorious</p>
<p>Sung to me and I was embittered for weeks because Freer bought it (from Yamanaka) for $1000. <u>less</u> than I had offered!</p>
<p>He has but one Sung vase that is outstanding – a “sky after rain” blue – <s>and</s> but unless my memory tricks me both Eumo and Peters have as fine if not finer – no single bit of his (early) pottery equals the Parish Watson pieces or the two large bowls that Loo had – or some of Eumo's</p>

<p>fine things.</p>
<p>I was most impressed by the rooms devoted to sculpture – where there are outstanding fine things, many of which I had not seen before and I am led to wonder if they are not recent (Lodge) acquisitions – It is useless to attempt to, really, describe them, and as soon as it is possible, I will send you photographs – in particular of 2 huge reliefs of scenes from the life of Buddha (6 cent.) and a delightful lacelike carved front of a platform for Buddhist images of the Tang dynasty.</p>
<p>I was bothered a good deal by Siren who was busily photographing both in the study rooms and galleries. He seemed to have such unlimited freedom that I thought he was one of the staff but Lodge said not merely that being a “very serious critic” things were put at his entire disposal – That is one good point. Lodge evidently intends that “serious students” (he emphasized the serious very noticeably) should own</p>
