<p>about Benson – Call him R.H. Ben or something in your letter – If you use the first two initials I will understand.</p>
<p>I am really quite overwhelmed by the kindness here – I am leaving my sitting room filled (as it has been all the time) with flowers, fruit & candy – I cannot <u>possibly</u> carry it & have sent off <u>heaps</u> to hospitals –</p>
<p>J.P.M. is the <u>only</u> American in good standing here which of course accounts for my reception. I was made fully aware of that today</p>
<p>Goodbye dearest. It is 2 [ <i>double underlined:</i> a.m.] Saturday</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>Belle</p>
