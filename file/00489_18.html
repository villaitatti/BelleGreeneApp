<p>Knecht told me that he and Casenove went there, reluctantly, for dinner, and found Hearst’s right hand man Brisbane, at the table – Needless to say, that also was cabled over – I hear that he is now cuddling up to Belgium, Omont asked me about him when here – I simply referred him to any man of standing in the community.</p>
