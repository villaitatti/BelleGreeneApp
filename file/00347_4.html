<p>outrageously – so I said to T.R. once rather suddenly “Are you a Liar?” – He <u>snapped</u> back, “Are You?”– “ <u>Yes</u> ”, said I – “Why?” he jumped at me “It’s the notes of the Beast”, I said – “Well, said he <s>"</s> and he jammed his fist down on the seat, “if <u>I</u> lie, that’s not the cause”– I felt rather badly whipped –</p>
<p>I have just received two fat letters from you, so I take back all the complaints in my last – One dated Aug. 8-10, the other Aug. 11-13th – There is no new development here since my last, with the exception that this morning Japan has declared war on Germany. A most insolent, unwarranted and cowardly move, I think.</p>
<p>Now, you <u>Most Dearly</u> Beloved, it is curious that [^when^] I wrote you about coming here, I suggested a tiny apartment, and in your letter just received you query the same. It seems to me, that as far as you personally, and your interests are concerned, you could <u>not</u> do better than to come here, either early in October or before –</p>
