<p>[p. 11]</p>
<p>I am made perfectly wretched by letters from most of my friends who are in Italy or Egypt or other enchanting places, and having the most beautiful and almost unbelievable experiences –</p>
<p>To think that it is <u>only</u> a year ago since I saw you last – it seems perfectly incredible – the calendars <u>must</u> lie, it is ages, centuries, aeons, many & many an incarnation since your lips touched mine! How</p>
<p>[p. 12]</p>
<p>have I managed to live through it, I wonder? It makes me despise the human frame which persists in going on and on and on – when one’s real life has stopped – is dead –</p>
<p>I wish I were as philosophical as you and could lie content with what we have had – alas! I want more & more & <u>still</u> [<i>double underlined</i>: more]! –</p>
<p>Devotedly yours <u>always</u></p>
<p>Belle –</p>
