<p>I hope not – I want us to be exactly the same as we were, to take up “our” thread of life <u>exactly</u> where we left it – but I should not be at all surprised if we had to begin all over – but at any rate do you be patient with me – for no matter <u>what</u>  <u>you</u> are I shall love you with a most peculiar</p>
<p>love – a love I have never given to any other human being – a love that is of my best such as that is –</p>
<p>Will you be an angel and engage rooms for me somewhere in London – I want a bedroom with bath, and a sitting room, also a room (separate)</p>
