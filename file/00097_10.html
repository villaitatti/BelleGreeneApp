<p>wiser if Bing would keep it until J. P. comes over (early in February) and then I will send Bing a note asking him to take it to J. P. & will prepare J. P. to buy it. That is really the better way but do exactly as you like – Please send me a photograph of the Bartolo di Fredi if you can – oh! & do tell that man Doucet that on your endorsement I have written Quaritch to send him a copy of our Catalogue of books & manuscripts</p>
