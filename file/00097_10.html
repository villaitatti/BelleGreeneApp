<p>bothered with them and wouldn’t I give them a dinner at his expense so I suppose I shall have to but it won’t beany thingto brag of I can promise you – If you want to ask Bing to send the necklace here on inspection with one chance in a hundred of our buying it –please do so– I shall do all I can to make J. P. take it as I like it so much – but as it would be sent to the South Kensington I think it would be <u>much</u> </p>

That is really the better way but do exactly as you like – Please send me a photographof the Bartolodi Fredi if you can – oh! & do tell that man Doucet that on your endorsement I have written Quaritch to send him a copy of ourCatalogueof books & manuscripts</p>
