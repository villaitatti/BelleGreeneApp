<p>Mary for her delightfully cordial letter – My <u>only</u> thought in not planning to get to see you <s>both</s> was because of your combined ill health. I most certainly cannot (or could not) think of imposing myself upon her & you, at such a time –</p>
<p> <u>If</u> you can honestly assure me (when we meet – or I hear from you) that her health (& yours) will permit of my visiting you for a day or so, I shall most certainly be delighted to come – forget my last letter until we meet – I was in a most frightful rage with the entire art world when I wrote it; and it is quite too silly of you to even suggest that it affects our relations in the slightest –</p>
<p>More when I see you –</p>
<p>I am rather appalled at all prices here. The clothes are very little cheaper than at home – and the exchange which <u>sounds</u> so beneficial in the papers</p>
