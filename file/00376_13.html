<p>things I have ever read –</p>
<p>Good night B.B. dearest – I loved your last letters so much because you did not scold me for not writing. I wish you knew how much I <u>long</u> to have you near – </p>
<p>Even old Uncle Henry says he loves you, and I am <u>sure</u> he does – a “dear man” he says you are – If you can conveniently do so tell them I told you I was working for them & with them – It’s a lie – but I’ve grown quite callous to lies.</p>
<p>I am going down to spend a weekend with Mrs. Widener on the 23rd of this month –</p>
<p><s>By the</s> Tell me – even if <u>you</u> don’t like them, do you approve of our Fragonard room <u>as</u> Fragonards? I may try to sell them then – Keep mum –</p>
<p>Ever Your devoted <u>Belle</u></p>
