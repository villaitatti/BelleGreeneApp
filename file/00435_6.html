<p>seen Ralph Cram's little volume the Nemesis of "Mediocrity?" I like that. I have seen a good deal of Mrs. Cram lately and like her more and more – She is very busy in helping Tom Whittemore with his work for the destitute Children in Russia. He has done awfully well and <s>it</s> his experience in Russia in the last 3 years has changed him amazingly.</p>
<p>Yes I see Leo Stein occasionally. He has passed through a period of what he calls "co-or-dinating" – whatever it is, it has made him a much more pleasant and agreeable person – He always talked well, but now he talks more humanly – He is writing some articles for the New Republic on the "Aesthetics of Art" – <u>If</u> I remember</p>
