<p>26 June, 1935.</p>
<p>Dear B.B.</p>
<p>I am giving this letter to my friend, Mrs. Adelyn Breeskin, who, aside from being the Curator of Prints and Drawings in the Baltimore Museum of Art, and the daughter of one of the Trustees of the Walters Art Gallery, is a delightful person in herself, whom I know you will be glad to meet.</p>
<p>Mrs. Breeskin is going to be in Florence in July, and I have urged her to take a chance of seeing you at I Tatti, then.</p>
<p>[ <i>Underlined in pen</i> : Devotedly] yours, [handwritten: (as always)</p>
<p> <u>Belle</u> ]</p>
<p>Mr. Bernard Berenson</p>
<p>I Tatti,</p>
<p>Settignano, Florence,</p>
<p>Italy.</p>
