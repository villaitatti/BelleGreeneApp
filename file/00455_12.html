<p>this year –</p>
<p>I’ll try to find time to write you toward the end of this week– I am going to Newport on Friday to stay with the Bakers & see some of the trial yacht races – I do hope that Bounder Tipton gets wiped off the yacht racing map for good – J.P is Commodore this year, so we are much excited about the races.</p>
<p>My love to you B.B. dear – There are two "roughnecks" here who are trying to spoil this–</p>
<p>Ever Your</p>
<p>Belle</p>
