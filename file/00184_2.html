<p>want to avoid it if possible – I hear that Ethel Grant is furious because I have broken with her & in a way I am sorry – but if I am to “reform” that surely is the first step to be taken. I have “cut out” all my engagements for the next fortnight so I will have all my time free for my sister, also it is better for me to keep quiet –</p>
<p>There have been a bunch of “celebrities” over here whom I have been asked to meet, but I have said nay to them all and stuck closely to my job which requires all my time these days –</p>
<p>I don’t feel very enthusiastic about anyone which I am sure you will agree is a <u>genuine</u> reform I hope I’ll hear from you soon</p>
<p>I’m tired and a bit discouraged. All the troubles seem to come at once. I wish you were here – all my love Your Belle –</p>
