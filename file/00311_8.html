<p>of the critics although he approved of you and Bode, but all the others were fakes – He seemed a bit disturbed by the advent of Sirén of whom he did not think over kindly – Mr. Clarke presented me with some pieces of Han pottery today. I think, if I remember corrected [sic] these pieces are all figured in Laufer’s book – a squatting hen or duck, a large open plate and a bucket of some kind – perhaps a well bucket. They have a lovely green, dull glaze and I like them although I never should have bought one – I’m rather tired of Han pottery except for some of the big pieces such as I saw at Boston. Goodbye for a while darling. Ever <u>Your</u> Belle</p>

<p>At last, dearest, I have a letter from you detailing your doings in the last days of Paris and your stay at the Villa Sylvia. The former is <u>much</u> too filled with ladies to interest my selfish and jealous person – but darling that awful old dub, Lady Herbert</p>
