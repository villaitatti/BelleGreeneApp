<p>P.S. Forget to tell you that – I saw Offner at St. Moritz. He was stopping at Maloia (or some such nearby place) with, ( <u>meaning</u> ) in the same hotel as Mrs. Loeser and large flocks of the Tribe. As he told me you had sent him a copy of your book I presume you are friends (even if distantly) again? <u>Is that true</u> ?Lemmenoso that I shall know how to conduct myself toward him. He said that he had broken with Helen Frick and thrown her $4000. perannumback in her face as she took him to task for “wasting her paid-for time” in allowing students to consult <u>him</u> about the photographs & art books there – that she said she “was not paying him for that” What a moth eaten useless pile of ignorant dust that female is!</p>
<p>Offner also is doing a great work on Florentine painting. I have subscribed (for the Library) because of the fine lot of reproductions. Have you?</p>

<p>[ <i>Written in darker ink in left margin</i> ]: On rereading Riefstahls ponderous & lengthy epistle I learn that you will have been in Constantinople long before this reaches you – and will have seen that <u>fascinating</u> basreliefat Antalia [sic] & the one at Smyrna of which he sent me photographs (plus 100 more!) How Roman that gent. looks? and how <u>early</u> ! I should love to have the original</p>
