<p>seeing, the many places I have been visiting but it is all <u>too</u> unimportant beside the one great fact of our love – my desire to kiss you, to be folded in your arms, to bury my face in your neck and to feel my passion for you flood you –</p>
<p>“All things were nothing to give</p>
<p>Once to have sense of you more</p>
<p>Touch you & taste of you sweet</p>
<p>Think you and breathe you and live –</p>
<p>I that have love and no more</p>
<p>Give you but love of you sweet</p>
<p>He that hath more let him give</p>
<p>He that hath wings let him soar</p>
<p>Mine is the heart at your feet</p>
<p>Here, that must love you to live”–</p>
<p>I often wonder, as I am talking with people <u>what</u> </p>
