<p>desperately in love with the Pollaiuolo portrait. It is a beauty and I like it next best to the Domenico and Botticelli – Joe Duveen was very amusing and entertaining & I really rather liked him – He implored me again (jokingly) to go into business with him – I was interested to find he wanted to buy Europeanmanuscriptsfor himself and especially that he liked one of the best I know a 12 centuryEnglishbelonging totheDuke of Devonshire – so even in those things he has good taste. Iurgedhim to buy the Domenico Veneziano and he decided he would, but today Siren told me that it had been sent to the Boston Museum on inspection Siren told me that he hadurgedthem not to buy it <u>as</u> the price was so high and he thought they could get two or three good pictures for that price – I fear S. has not a very high option of Ross but of course I said all the grand things I could think of about Ross to him. Freer writes me that he will be here on Monday so he must be very much better. I find I made a mistake about the bronze beast at Worch. It is 25000 – <u>not</u> 45000. Freer offered 20.000. for it but Worch would not accept it – Well my letters seem to be all about dealers – It is your fault you</p>
