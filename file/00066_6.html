<p>I have bought a little hole in the ground up at Tuckahoe and am going to move up there directly I return. It is a shanty-bungalow but large enough to hold two <s>people</s> [^guests^] every night and I think it will be a lark for the summer. As I always go away on a visit to someone every week end, it will not become too monotonous</p>
<p>How I wish you were here & were to be up there with me at <u>least</u> two nights a week</p>
<p>The shanty is in the midst of a large woods & there are all sorts of charming walks & drives & hidden places galore – I would love you <u>so</u> much Beloved – I would kiss you until you cried for mercy and I could cuddle up in your arms and go to sleep with my mouth on yours & my heart on yours – with your hands in my hair and with mine round your neck – And I would wake you in the morning by little soft kisses all over your face & neck – of a surety it will all come to pass Beloved – I know it as I know that I am yours <u>forever</u> – Belle</p>
