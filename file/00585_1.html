<p>Dear B.B.</p>
<p>I enclose an extract from a letter Helen Franc wrote me. You were an Angel to enthrall her (just as I wanted you to do!).</p>
<p> <u>I</u> think that she will go (soon!) far beyond Offner, and in about 100 years’ time catch up with you- that is – in <u>Ita</u> lian Art (only) –</p>
<p>Wish I were going to see you this Summer, but I <u>must</u> do the Museums, Libraries, and Music in Germany and Austria. Just think how disgraceful it is that I have never visited those countries!</p>
<p>I sail on the Bremen (tourist, alas!) on July 17th. Go to Berlin, reaching there about the 24th, and will use the American Express Company, 3 Unter den Linden, Berlin, as my address for a week or so.</p>
<p>I’ll try to write you a personal letter from the boat.</p>
<p>Heaps of Everything, [ <i>handwritten</i> :(shall I say “including”– or “besides” LUV? Belle]</p>
<p>P.S. I understand on the best authority that the plans of the Fogg Museum (through Gus Meyer [sic] of Colnaghi, London) to capture all of the Albertina drawings has fallen through. I never could understand how it would be possible. [ <i>handwritten:</i> We are bidding on a few of the Oppenheimer drawings, but I really do not expect to get any as there is tremendous competition from all sides]</p>
