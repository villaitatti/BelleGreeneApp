<p>Dear Mr. Berenson –</p>
<p>I am so glad that you are going to be a <u>real</u> friend (than which there is no rarer thing in God’s world!) that</p>
<p>I can <u>almost</u> forgive you for not lunching with me – for I must confess that I am really <u>dreadfully</u> disappointed about that for I did hope to have a quiet chat</p>
