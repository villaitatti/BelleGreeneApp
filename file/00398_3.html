<p>a most dreadful show on here. I cannot describe it to you as I went <s>out</s> in and <u>out</u> as quickly as possible –</p>
<p>Yes Freer is all over the place – You know I'm almost ashamed to say that I occasionally get frightfully tired of him – He tells the same story <u>so</u> often.</p>
<p>Hervey Wetzel is leaving for Japan on Saturday of this week to be gone six months or more. I do envy him so much – I'd love to go over in late September to stay for the <s>Crhy</s> chrysanthemum festival Shall we go together instead of my trying to make Italy this year?</p>
<p>This town is just crammed full of bad & mediocre Chinese stuff. All the Japs are here with fakes & trash and the Peepul are buying greedily – I think I told you about the wonderful bronze vessel</p>
