<p>lunched with him yesterday & told him that if he hit Italy on his way back to be <u>sure</u> to present himself to you – you will <u>simply</u> adore him – Among other things he is fleeing from wifey – or as he so deliciously put it, insofar as <u>she</u> is concerned, he prefers the Mount of God to the Mount of Venus.
