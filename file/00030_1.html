<p>My dear –</p>
<p>I have been in such a condition of turmoil – since I last wrote you that I cannot remember just what I did or did not say – I spent the inglorious Fourth and a few days preceding at Newport where I</p>
<p>was dragged around until I frankly protested and refused to be “run”</p>
<p>It is quite distasteful to one – you and I differ in this respect I think more than in any other – People (as important social factors) mean so much to <s>an</s> you and <u>nothing whatever</u> to me – Most of my friends think</p>
