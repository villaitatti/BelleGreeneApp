<p>23 Sept. 1928</p>
<p>B.B. me Grouchy-Lamb.</p>
<p>You certainly deserve this yaller paper and scrubby pencil for that cryptic letter which greeted me on my return the other day – I have not the faintest idea what it is all about save that it bites, snarls and scratches and icily terminates with ‘Cordially B. Berenson’ or something like that.</p>
<p>I really did want to see you most awfully this summer but I went over with solemn promises to J.P.M and everyone who concerns himself with this wastrailMahoumist to do nothing, see no-one, and go nowhere except to Switzerland in a last desperate endeavor to get well – and for 90% of my time that is all I did, and I feel, and they tell me look, like a new person (just as UGLY however!) The last 12 days I spent motoring about Southern France from Paris, Dijon, Arles, Avignon, Les Baux, Aigues mortes, Carcassone, Tours, Chartres & Paris 1 day then here</p>
