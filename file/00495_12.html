<p>the Clermont-Tonnere lady is having difficulties with her husband, also that she has published a book on her American visit –</p>
<p>I shall do nothing for a time about sending you duplicates of the photographs which did not reach you, as Perkins wrote me about the middle of <u>June</u> , that he had only <u>then</u> received the packages of photos which I sent him while you were still here – so even yours may turn up by nextXmas–</p>
<p>Yes – dear B.B – I often wondered why you were so incensed with Helen Frick & Mr. Witt for gathering up photographs, when you yourself are a bit famous for bending all your efforts to getting as many as possible – It all teaches me to have no thought for Posterity – Even as a noble Pretense –</p>
<p>Now I must be at my reading</p>
