<p>breath of the unseen – for a longer and truer glimpse of which I would willingly give my life – all that I hope to be – On such a night the best of the past sheds its perfume over me – today holds one’s hand as if one were a child and tomorrow shines like a star.</p>
<p>This morning my young “cynic” got me</p>
