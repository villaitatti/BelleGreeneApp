<p>gleam was gone, the water flowing away – but I had had them. I had received from them their beauty they had given me of their silent mystery – and I thought of you – dear – of the fleeting hours I had spent with you – and they too like the water & sunshine had flown</p>
<p>away – but the beauty and mystery of them remain and in my thoughts are multiplied a thousandfold</p>
<p>How wonderful that you wish to give me so much of yourself! From the littleness and meanness and pettinesses forced upon me by circumstances and other people – what a relief and joy to turn to the abundance of your love – you do not know how</p>
