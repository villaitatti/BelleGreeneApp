<p>long one to Rome asking me when I left, arrived etc. & I had replied saying I would spend the night at Siena. I wrote her a letter which I gave to Lorenzetti saying I had not really the cheek to impose myself and maid upon her when She was ill in bed but that it would give me great pleasure to come to see her – but I feared I could not do so before</p>

<p>Sunday afternoon. I have just received a charming note from her saying she would motor in for me at 3 o’clock tomorrow & that I must stay and dine all of which I will do – I hope you approve – when I promised you that I would meet her kindness frankly I meant it and am trying to do all that you could desire, only I think you know dear, what it means to me to go to <u>your</u> house with <u>you</u> absent. and the fact that I can bring myself to do it is the first</p>
