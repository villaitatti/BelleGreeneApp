<p>believe that they are going to devote all their time to our collection – But I give it to you for what you think its [sic] worth.</p>
<p>I told Frick by the way, how much you liked his Rembrandt Polish Horseman and he was <u>vastly</u> tickled, but B.B. dear, you have no idea of how much it suffers, in a mental <s>capacity</s> comparison, with a similar Chinese painting I saw at Freers – the landscape, I will admit remains lovely.</p>
<p>but both horse and rider seem wooden, lifeless and almost at a standstill – <s>You</s> I may be quite wrong, but so it seems to me –</p>
<p>I went to an amusing Matisse show yesterday but as I only had ten minutes to give it, will go in again before I write – But, oh Lord! <u>what</u> a topsy-turvy world –</p>
<p>Many thanks for the copy of Lowes Dickinson’s Appearances which you sent me – I have not glanced at it yet as I have spent all my free minutes before going to sleep, rereading my beloved “Mille Nuits” – isn’t</p>
