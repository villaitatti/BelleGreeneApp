<p>Catalogue – but as we are only planning to have a short "guide" I think I will have Dan Fellowes Platt do it as he is on the Committee with several others including Bob Lehman –</p>
<p>At this moment I have <u>no</u> idea how it will turn out – but, if it is <u>not</u> a unique showing it will at least be unusual in that we are going to include sculpture, bronzes etc. etc & a <u>few</u> Gothic</p>
