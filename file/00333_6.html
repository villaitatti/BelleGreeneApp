<p>[p. 9]</p>
<p>Thursty is off on a little vacation so I am holding the fort alone – I love it – It is so quiet and intimate and meaningfull [sic]. Valentiner was <u>very</u> much surprised that Boston got the Goulebeff [sic] Collection so cheap and could not understand it – I feel blue and tired and dispirited today and all I ask of the world is to be with you – I never quite lose thought of you and sometimes (at night!) I become rebellious at not being able to see you oftener. I’m going to get rich by book or crook so I can live over there. I’m so tired of having to stay here when everybody – even the commonest people can run over as much as they please – so I <u>refuse</u> to remain a pauper & poor working gal any longer and am going to rifle the first fat bank account I see.</p>
<p>Mr. Jack was in all this morning and bored me to death – everybody & everything does</p>
