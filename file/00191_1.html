<p>Tuesday <u>April 23</u> </p>
<p>Dear B. B. –</p>
<p>This is to be truly only a <u>line</u> . I have been and am, up to my ears in work for the Titanic survivors & lost – am on two committees and work until late every night –</p>
<p>of course you too must have been stunned by this dreadful calamity. My heart almost breaks when I think of dear little Harry Widener – Mrs. George is very dangerously ill from the shock –</p>
<p>I will write you a real letter as soon as I am able</p>
