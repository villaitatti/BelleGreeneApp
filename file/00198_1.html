<p>Dear B. B. –</p>
<p>The heat has been so <u>disgustingly</u> intense here, for the first two or three weeks that I have not had energy even for writing. It has rather done me up & I feel more like a limp rag than a human being – besides which I have been terrifically busy “house cleaning” in the Library – a process</p>
