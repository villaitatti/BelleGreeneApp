<p> <u>Tuesday Oct. 27</u> </p>
<p>10 p.m –</p>
<p>Well me darlint – Here I am at the Library with a Persian gent named Tahizadreb or something that that who is deciphering some of our Persian manuscript for me – He is a small dark critter with the most exquisite manners and as quiet as a mouse – He has done similar work in the British Museum & so there is very little I have to tell him – You ought to hear</p>

<p>him read some of the verselets around the miniatures. It sounds like the dripping of a fountain and when the poetry becomes “lovery” like the purring of a well fed kitten. He comes every Tuesday evening and we work here until midnight – He is gradually bringing order out of the chaos of those manuscripts for me –</p>
<p>I met an Italian friend of mine for luncheon today and found him frantically pro-German – so much so that he says if Italy fights</p>
