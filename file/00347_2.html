<p>River of Doubt – After luncheon he sat on a bench in the woods with Gutzon and me and told us in detail all his experiences on that dreadful journey –They made an average of <u>2</u> miles a <u>day</u> – think of it – He told me how one man went crazy and shot himself, how another went crazy and ran away into the jungle & was lost and how he was delirious for over a week – Then we talked, or rather <u>they</u> talked politics, and he declared he was for “the <u>fusion</u> of the finer element of the Republican and Progressive party” I was not so carried away by his compelling personality, as to <u>ignore</u> this remark and am sure it really means he <s>was </s>[^is^] bidding for the Republican nomination – He uttered some very high and noble sentiments, but I felt they were pretty much “for publication” – He looks like a gorilla when he is excited. I was <u>horribly</u> flattered at his notice of me, I am willing to admit – It quite turned my head at the time and again later, when everybody came up</p>
