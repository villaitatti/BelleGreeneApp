<p>for a week or two at the time – but if you <u>cannot</u> manage to come here, then I want to go over – We, of <u>course</u> could be much more together & much more alone <u>there</u> . I am beginning to arrange my work now to that end, and as I say the only question is of <s>the</s> ability to get there & back without be [sic] drowned or "bombed" or detained for some foolish reason – The main point of this letter dearest, is to</p>
<p> <u>beg</u> you to suspend judgment about my not loving you until we do meet – You may find me quieter & not so stimulating – perhaps you will find me duller – but at least you will find me loving you more deeply & more consciously and more – almost <u>maternally</u> I'm sure you howled with laughter at that, but sometimes I have that <u>kind</u> of a feeling about you – <u>you dear</u> </p>
<p>Of mere "gossip" I have heaps</p>
