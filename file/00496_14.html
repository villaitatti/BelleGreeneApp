<p>the above, I <u>know</u> that you won’t do it – that is, won’t do anything [<i>double underlined</i>: really] worth the time and the trouble to which you will put yourself – You will motor to heavenly places, see heavenly things, expound and explain them to your dear heart’s content and gratification, and, du reste, take it out in patting, pecking, and <u>loping</u> – there, if even that amuses you, bless you, my child & <u>go to it.</u></p>
