<p>[p. 15] </p>
<p>came home this afternoon after a <u>most</u> glorious canter around the park and up and down Riverside Drive, to see my seamstress – who must let all my belts out, <u>one inch</u>. I think it grand – but she is thoroughly disgusted – said I was so “sveldt” before – </p>
<p>Dined on – let me see – Monday with that wise Nevill who had (only) the Geddes (Brit. Ambass. & wife) They were going on to some reception later, so I took him back to the Library – BBest – it <u>was</u> so quiet and warm – so glowing <u>and</u> so deliciously smelly (I know I’m utterly <u>silly</u> about that place!)  Saw heaps of <u>your</u> [<i>in print</i>: LADY] friends</p>
