<p>it do tell me what value it has.</p>
<p>They gave me a private view of the exhibition of Modern Painting which is to open next week – I think it is splendid. They have some ripping Cezannes, Gauguin, Degas – Courbet, etc Redon etc It is well hung & very carefully chosen – Most of Agnes Meyer’s things are in it as also Mrs <u>Havemeyer</u> – Miss Bliss etc. </p>
<p>I went up to see Kouchaikjis [sic] Antioch Chalice – some hireling was there who had never heard my name (<u>imagine that</u>!) and made so many objections that I dropped my card on the table & walked out – needless to say they have been telephoning ever since – I’ll go up early next week – <u>understand</u> it is a <u>marvel</u>.</p>
<p>Last Friday morning I motored to Princeton with the Dan Platts </p>
