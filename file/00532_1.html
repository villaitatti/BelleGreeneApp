<p>Dear B.B. –</p>
<p>You remember I wrote you about my friend Betty Shonnard, who is going to Italy to see for <u>herself</u> (she's from Oshkosh!) if this vague rumour about ART, she’s <u>just</u> heard is true – and</p>
<p>to buy some arty furniture through Diego de Suarez –</p>
<p>She’s arriving about the 10th of May and although I am <u>sure</u> you will scorn her (but she’s <u>so</u> lovable – and I <u>love</u> her), I must have her know <u>you</u> – so won’t you be ‘nice’ – <u>very</u> to her please & relax</p>
