<p>I have decided that if I am to go on living I <u>must</u> pull myself <u>together</u> . I really cannot tell you what a nightmare these last two weeks have been to me – it may seem strange to you, with the actual scene of battle so far away from me, but I do assure you that all thinking people here are actually in the same condition – It seems to me that unless a decisive</p>
<p>blow is struck Germany very soon, we <u>must</u> jump in and help annihilate the Beast –</p>
<p>Goodby dearest – I shall try to write constantly again. in any case you need never attribute a pause in my letter to a lessening of my love for you – I love you more and am more “in love” with you everyday – How I long to have you with me, only <u>you</u> could know – a thousand kisses and a mind and heart full of love – Ever your Belle.</p>
