<p>her and her future is now taken off my shoulders – the other sister, Genevieve, wants to plunge right in but the man with whom she <u>thinks</u> she is in love has not a sou with which to bless himself so I will hear nothing of <u>that</u> . My brother and sister-in-law are now living down here with us: she is the kind that is so refined and well-born that she is inane and inert & she loves me to death – but I love my brother. He and I are the greatest chums and as a matter of fact he is about <u>the</u> only man I see during the week – Meyer-Riefstahl took me down to the Cooper Institute the other day to see the Coptic and Sassanian [sic] textiles – He has written an article on them for the August Art in America – He fell so hard for my “charms?” that I had to stop seeing him – this in spite of the fact that I understand his <u>wife</u> is busy</p>
