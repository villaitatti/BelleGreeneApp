<p>the biggest liars in the world – the same thing happened with Frick – The amazing thing to me is that Jack M. treats the D’s like the scum of the earth – as if they were <u>lepers</u> – makes them <u>stand</u> all the time they are talking to him and is <u>frightfully</u> insulting to them – well the amazing part is that they take it all and virtually lick his hands in gratitude – Jack M. and I roar in laughter about it all – He despises them to an extraordinary degree and leaves all the business to <u>me</u> for that</p>
