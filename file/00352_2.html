<p>Morgan came in the Library this morning and was quite enraged when I repeated all these things to him – He is very strongly in sympathy with the French and is going back on Saturday to do all he can to help them – Murray has been sitting in my lap all day and purring like a well fed and sleepy kitten. He tells me that the Duveens are coming here in October. That they are only stopping this long in London to grab every rich American who passes through there. He</p>
<p> <u>again</u> and emphatically told me how anxious they were to do business with Mr. Jack etc. etc – I asked him if he had written the Duveens advising them to come over or to any other effect – but he said oh! no – not he – he was <u>far</u> too crafty to give them anything in writing</p>
<p>He again told me that Uncle Henry told of all the money that was, even then, coming <s>into</s> in, from their American clients and that they were in high spirits – He does not believe that Widener paid much over the purchase</p>
