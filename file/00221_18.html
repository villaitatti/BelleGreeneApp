<p>horribly long letter – I have lots more gossip, which I will save up for next time – after the 11th when the Library will be closed – you will be correct in assuming I don’t love you if I don’t write oftener – All joy and happiness and good health and [<i>double underlined: </i>love] for the New Year Belovedest – May it bring us together <u>in Every way</u></p>
<p>Always your</p>
