<p>the matter is hopeless but I think that if he would absolutely trust you – you could make his collection a great one – I made a great point with him several times – of his forming a small but choice collection – the eliminations of many mediocrities for one example of the first quality – entailing of necessity – a large outlay of money. I suggested that you would be invaluable to him – Although he, in so many ways resembles a child, (ill-bred and vulgar) he is at the same time wily & of a naturally distrustful</p>
<p>disposition – He is very frank with me because he knows that I have nothing to gain through him – My feeling about him is quite personal – I have snubbed him frequently and continuously & yet only the other day he told someone how much he admired me & that I was “so kind” to him!!!</p>
<p>It is But really it is quite foolish to consider him ˆat allˆ except in his relations to his collection – He is so far removed socially that he does not have to be considered in that light at all –</p>
<p>You say you have spoken to his partner (whom I do not know) and to Hobby whom I do know –</p>
