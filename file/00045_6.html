<p>my friends. I can’t understand their even knowing him – Duveen is a prince in comparison – An interesting man from the Berlin Museum came lately – Dr. Friedländer</p>
<p>I liked him very much & we got on swimmingly, He taught me a lot the few times I saw him & I sincerely regretted that he was not to spend the winter here – I am having my portrait painted & will send you a photo of it when finished – Did you ever get the one</p>
