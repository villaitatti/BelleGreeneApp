<p>one a week – I wish I did not dislike <u>mere</u> letter writing so much. I want to talk to <u>you</u> but I hate to settle down with a pen before a blank page – I suppose that, as usual, I have forgotten to answer <u>all</u> of your questions but they will have to wait now until “next time” –</p>
<p>Ever <u>your</u>  <u>Belle</u> </p>
