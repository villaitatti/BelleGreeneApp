<p>the American public is permitting itself to draw a long breath. The way interest has been concentrated on his health and return from health-seeking is, I presume characteristic of the day, but utterly repulsive and disgusting to me. The poor foolish ones have wrecked the market and thereby ruined only themselves with their useless “Theories” guesses & fears as to what Harriman will do with the Pacifics’ finances in the existing posture of affairs</p>
<p>To me, the only interest converges on the question of how this quintessence of activity, this cunning yet gigantic schemer, will adapt himself to the remorseless programme of rest,</p>
