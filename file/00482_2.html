<p>[p. 2]</p>
<p>with maddening green floriated borders around every page – the sort of thing they are now doing to Madrus’ [sic] Mille nuits – of the latter, only last week, I refused as a gift a set costing $450. – the text, my adored text was strangled, choked as with weeds, by near-Arabic decorations –</p>
<p>By the way I always think of Bedier’s [sic] Tristan and Madrus’ [sic] together – <u>I</u> could not say that either was finer – more lovable, more enchanting – more delicious music to the ear – than the other. What do you think? <u>Be sure to tell me </u></p>
<p><s>The nearest approach to the Tristan, in English, that I know, is Andrew Lang’s translation of Aucassin & Nicolette [sic] and the lays of </s><u>Marie</u><s> de France – </s></p>
<p>Thousands of thanks for telling </p>
