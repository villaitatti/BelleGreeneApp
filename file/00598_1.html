<p>Dear B.B.:</p>
<p>I am so happy to have your New Year’s letter, as I had not heard from you for so long. How quickly it came! Only four days in transit.</p>
<p>What a wonderful person you are – your writing and all about you just the same as years and years ago. I shall never cease to be grateful and happy to have known and <u>loved</u> you.</p>
<p>I was fascinated by your recent “memoirs” in the Art News and am sure that lots of people have written you the same. Of course, you will write more books for us all to gloat over and enjoy and we all await them.</p>
<p>I am not very well after yet another bad fall, so that now I hobble along on canes, but as I still can afford a taxicab, get to the Library all right, but see as few people as possible.</p>
<p>I presume that you have heard of our appalling snowstorm of over a week ago – the drifts were almost chin high, no snowplows the first few days, no street cleaning, etc., etc., just snow and more snow. The only fortunate thing was that there was not a blizzard wind.</p>
<p>There is no news worth writing of, just stale and boring gossip about no one of any interest. I don’t doubt that you hear some better, but I really do not care about any of it any more. I thank God that everyone is taking such splendid care of you – but <u>wish</u> that we had you here to do the same.</p>
<p>This is a poor apology for a Happy New Year letter to you, but it is all I can do today, one of my tired and blue days.</p>
<p>My love to you, dearest B.B., and do write me soon.</p>
<p>Belle</p>
