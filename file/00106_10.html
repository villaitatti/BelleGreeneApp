<p>my mind I was in for it so spent an hour canceling all my engagements for that time & wrote her to come on & be damned – She wired at once that she would come – She is quite struck on a man I know who <u>thinks</u> – no that is not fair to him, who really <u>is</u> much in love with me and Ethel is taking his part violently which of course both you & I understand – I really work into her hands for it keeps her tongue off you & so keeps me from having a scrap with her – I am only sorry for poor little McComas who is really a fine boy of 35 – a landscape painter and deserves a much finer woman than me – I shall have to disillusion him after she goes – Poor child –</p>
