<p>I hope it will all be settled shortly and that I will soon have the enchanting things. I did not send the grape fruit before as you spoke of staying at I Tatti only four or five days but I will ship some the early part of next week and take the chance of their reaching you – I will send you the Murray drawings Catalogues as soon as they reach here – and the photographs as soon as I have a minute in which to have them taken – I have</p>
<p>already written you about the writing paper – Let me do <u>any thing</u> I can for you darling – <u>Any thing</u> – I only wish I were some grand great person who could be of <u>real</u> service to you – Don’t forget for one moment that I love you – I pray we may meet before very long – Perhaps we can arrange <u>something</u> for this August. I fear I shall not be able to come over but we will get together somehow – oh! my dear if I could kiss you kiss your dear eyes & mouth – Belle.</p>
