<p>Geoffrey Scott for infidelity – Pretty cheeky of her isn’t it, from all the tales I’ve heard – But I dare say she settled a good sumuponhim which may save you from doing that same–</p>
<p>Billee Ivins wrote me a most extraordinary account of a motortripwith you to Vallombrosa–It was very wonderful truly & when he comes back I’m going to make himincorporatethat & some other brilliantbitshe haswrittenduring his tripinto a fewessays– They are <u>miles</u> ahead of anything which appears in thejournalsover here – I think he got more out of that drive and the tea time in the “valley of Virgil & Ovid as he called it(onlybetter than that) than anything else at I Tatti except You, whom he adores – even while you consume his entire attention with wonderings & speculations, I suggested to him that he allow himself to utterly relax when with you, into utter, somnolent (if necessary) adoration of you – in which event he would be able to actually ‘ <u>get</u> ’ you – that he would find you quietly graciouslyseeping <u>into</u> him, just as some rarely beautiful thing does, if You are receptively quiet before it & don’t muddle up the intervening atmospherewithqueries & speculations – I know he’ll come right back at me with “ <u>Do</u> [ <i>double</i>  <i>underlined</i> : you?]” – and I’m going to answer “Yes – when he’s not playing the emasculated Pasha to a bunch ofnonnentitiesin the guise of females” –</p>
<p>It would do Billee, a <u>world</u> of good to be with you ([ <i>quadruple underlined</i> : alone!]) for a month or so – but certainly <u>not</u> </p>
