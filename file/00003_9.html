<p>if my convictions ˆinstinctsˆ were all wrong after all – Are they Dear? – How I wish you had been here this heavenly day – This a wonderful combination of Saint Patricks’ & Spring and “sure Heaven is not far distant on a day in Spring” – Goodnight Dear – may the God of all Good Things keep you & bring you safe back to me –</p>
<p>Yours without a struggle</p>
<p>Belle.</p>
<p>P.S. The following is an extract from a poem that was written sent to me today by a young man I have been trying to help – I thought it would amuse you as it is so much like something you once said –</p>
<p>“Thy hapless eyes –</p>
<p>Happy in their imprintment of thy dreams</p>
<p>Thy brow the whitened beach for thought’s loose tide</p>
<p>Thy cheeks a moor of berries, brown and red” –</p>
