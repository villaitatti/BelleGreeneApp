<p>must have suddenly acquired a filthy dealer-look – for all of these men, even Kevorkian insinuate what wonderful things they will do for me if I will help “work up” a craze for Chinese & Persian things & bring in people. I laugh at them all and tell them that they amuse me, otherwise I should feel insulted –</p>
<p>Agoness telephoned asking me to dinner but I could not go – she backed out very gracefully on the bronzes – said something so funny that I <u>must</u> tell you – said I, “Well, the things all coming back from Freer so you can “dive in” & buy them as you threatened to.” Oh! said A – I have scruples about paying a large sum of money for <u>one</u> art object – especially when I think how I could have a <u>whole room</u> full of modern paintings for that amount!” – I shrieked with laughter over the telephone <u>such</u> a “give away” for a person who is so high up in art – must run now – More tomorrow –</p>
