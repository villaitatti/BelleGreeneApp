<p>a comparatively short time and as far as <u>she</u> is concerned anyhow, is a genuine love affair – Your friend Mrs. Lydig has taken a house on Washington Square. Everyone is wondering <u>where</u> her money comes from! Dr. Riefstahl got <s>tak</s> together a very good collection of textiles which is being exhibited in Paris – He tries to hang around on a good deal but I take pains to</p>
<p>remind him rather regularly of his wife and children in England. I don't believe he cares much about her although I am sure she has done a great deal for him in a business way. I can't have him at my house very much as everyone I know (including myself) objects to the presence of <u>any</u> German no matter how nice he is – I am seriously thinking of selling the Limoges Enamels and Lèvres</p>
