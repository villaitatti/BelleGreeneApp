<p>“As Mr. Freer is a stakeholder & partner with Worch & the others” so Agoness is parrot-like repeating it all – but fortunately I do not know a single person who considers her opinion in any way – As I wrote you before I am awfully tired of that female</p>
<p>She seems more incredibly stupid & conceited every time I see her and more satisfied with her utterly inane and useless self – It will be all over but the mourning when she loses her good looks – Just had a call from the Editor of the Ladies Home Journal who offered me $500. for a one page article a – “Women’s</p>
<p>Supremacy in a Man’s Field”</p>
<p>I told him I did not know what he was talking about and never heard of any such phenomenon –</p>
<p>Later</p>
<p> <u>Some</u> foreign mail must be in as I have received two long letters from Read, very giddy & very amusing. He is quite caustic about Agoness and gives <u>me</u> a few good digs in the ribs as well. Says I am altogether too self-centered a person etc. etc. which, as I remember is very much your own opinion. At the same time he begs me to “elope” with him for the week-end as <u>he</u> says</p>
