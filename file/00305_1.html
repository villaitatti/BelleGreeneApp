<p>Monday afternoon</p>
<p>April 13</p>
<p>B.B. you angelic one –</p>
<p>It was perfectly <u>thrilling</u> to find your steamer letter awaiting me at the Library this morning and to know that hereafter I shall have them uninterruptedly – Poor dear, what a terrible voyage you had – I never <u>heard</u> of such a combination of ills – So now you know how devilish and enthralling a cold can be! And that horrible medicine that was to <u>prevent</u> seasickness You</p>
<p>[p. 2]</p>
<p>remember I <u>told</u> you that Glaenzer would not bother you – what I can tell you now, but <u>could</u> not before is that, in reality he firmly believes that you are trying to “get in” with Seligmann! in fact that you are to be Seligmann’sfor the asking! Isn’t it fun? You were mean not to tell me what Mrs.Hewittsaid about me – Don’t I repeat all the gossip, even unpleasant to you and you might have given me the joy of hearing what “they” are saying</p>
