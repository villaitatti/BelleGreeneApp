<p>my love for you and yours for me that I <u>can’t</u> help loving everyone – Miss Thurston does not know that I am planning to come over by September so don’t you tell her! – It might discourage her so she would not return as she is dreadfully afraid of J. P. & hates to be here alone with him – I should <u>love</u> to</p>
<p>stay quietly with you in Italy if it is at <u>all</u> possible – of course we do not want to <u>invite</u> all sorts of criticism – You let me know won’t you dear – If you think it alright and <u>perfectly</u> safe – I’ll come – In any case we will be together <u>somewhere</u> . I did not go to Philadelphia after all so have not seen Johnson again. I am glad he is so devoted to you –</p>
