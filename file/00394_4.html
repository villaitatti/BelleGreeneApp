<p>porcelains at auction but it will take a lot of persuading to make Mr. Jack Morgan agree. I am sure that he has made a great deal of money and so does not have to sacrifice them – as he feared he would have to do – I have not heard anything from the Duveens. I suppose they are busy buying up all the fine things in England. <u>I</u> have not yet seen Loo's things but am going up there this afternoon and will keep this open to report to you. I am also going to see Bahr's things <s>of which</s> He is holding a private show of them today – Breck and I have been slumming around a bit. He is as usual, looking for bargains for the Minneapolis Museum – By the way, when you come over, we <u>must</u> set aside a week for the Middle-West</p>
