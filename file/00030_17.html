<p>at the British Museum – he quite loved my library – It was a joy to have him because he is one of the few men whom really knows about incunabula. If I can ever get away for several months I am going over to study with him – Beloved it frightens me when I stop long enough to think of how much I have to learn –</p>
<p>“Last night, last night in dreams we met</p>
<p>And how today shall I forget</p>
<p>Or how, remembering, restrain</p>
<p>Mine incommunicable pain?</p>
