<p>Dear B.B –</p>
<p>I received your letter the morning I left Paris. It evidently crossed the one I wrote you –</p>
<p>I could not get even a berth on the Olympic or Mauretaniaand so had to take this old tub – which has almost driven me mad by its slothful progress – it reminds me of a dead whale</p>
<p>[p. 2]</p>
<p>wallowing upon the top of the water, first on its back, then on its side, then on its belly.</p>
<p>I am so anxious to get back that the enforced rest (8 days it's to be!) of this swine among boats, has had the effect of nearly driving me mad –</p>
<p>I am rather despairingly afraid for Jack Morgan –</p>
<p>There has rarely, if ever, been such love and devotion and complete living as existed between Mrs. Morgan and himself &</p>
