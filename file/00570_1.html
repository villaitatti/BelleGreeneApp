<p>Dear B.B.,</p>
<p>I am obeying your orders, in that I have [ <i>underlined in pink pencil</i> : <u>just</u>  <u>this</u> ] [ <i>deleted</i>  <i>in pink pencil</i> : <s>morning</s> ] [ <i>inserted</i>  <i>in pink pencil</i> : moment] read your letter of July 3rd. The drawing in question measures 336 x 319 cm., or 13 1/2 x 12 7/16 inches. The bistre is heightened with a bluish gray in the hats and garments of the three figures in the lower right, and in the face, beard, and hands of the two remaining lower figures; [ <i>parenthesis added in red pencil</i> : (that is, left and middle,)] also on the horses’s heads – this latter more or less as outline. It appears to me that what looks like a white wash in the upper half of the drawing, is sizing of the canvas, either left untouched by bistre, or it has, in those places, worn off.</p>
<p>I am sending you two photographs of it, and you will notice in the lower middle toward the left, a reparation which seems to me a later insertion, although certain of the folds toward the right in this bit have somewhat the character of the rest of the painting. The reproduction in the Murray Catalogue is, as you will see from my measurements, greatly reduced, as are the photographs which I am sending. When you saw the drawing here, you noted that “It was very fine indeed”. We are thoroughly of your opinion, but [ <i>quotation marks added in red pencil</i> : “the Offner”] stated that “It was not of the period.”</p>
<p>I have decided to finally ruin myself financially, by going to Italy this August, (taking my [ <i>deleted letter in</i>  <i>red pencil</i> : ne <s>w</s> phew], Bobby, with me) mainly for the long sea-trip of almost two weeks each way. I, so far, am only planning for two or three days in Venice, in order to show Bobby a few high spots in that divine place, and then go on to the beach at Rimini and just “sit” there for a space. I leave here on the S.S.Vulcania on August 3rd, and reach Venice the 17th or the 18th. I certainly would like to see you, if only for a day or two, and would make every effort to go up to [ <i>deleted</i>  <i>in red pencil</i> : <s>Cassino</s> ] [ <i>inserted</i>  <i>in red pencil</i> : Consuma] if the time permits, as I am leaving Italy on September 2nd per the S.S. Augustus.</p>
