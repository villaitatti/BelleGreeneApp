<p>write horrible essays & criticism on & of it – & my professor is as hard as nails – evidently his one idea in life is to prove to me how little I know & how little I shall ever know! I wonder if you know him? Vincent de Wierzbicki, prefixed by “Comte” which I absolutely refuse to use. I really think that deep down in his heart, carefully buried, is a kindly thought for me – at least so others tell me but he takes great care not to let me see it. He calls me a decadent and a mystic and says I live</p>
<p>in a bygone atmosphere and age and that it is his mission to wake me up – c’est amusant n’est-cepas?– I have three lessons a week with him & leave each one a limp & humble person. I am glad to say he is soon leaving for Europe – all of which of course does not interest you – why should it? I have not been doing anything worth telling you – dinners & luncheons & musicales & parties – all of which are a great waste of my time but which I continue to do nevertheless.</p>
