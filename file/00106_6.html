<p>Your friend Mrs. Blumenthal pursues me to death. She is really violently – no, <u>neurotically</u> in love with the Big Chief & he & I spend most of our time trying to avoid her – He can’t stand her & I can’t either much longer – but oh! [<i>double underlined:</i>daarrling] she has the most wonderful 12 Cent. Enamel I almost Ever saw – It consists of two figures only – an annunciation in wonderful <u>blues</u> & I <u>hate</u> her for having it – I will try to get a photograph for you. she won’t tell me where she got it – I lunched with Glaenzer & herself the other day – and had it not been for cher Eugène, would have been bored to tears. She raved as usual about Mrs. Lydig & how crazy Mrs. Lydig</p>
