<p>[<i>handwritten</i>: My dear BB]</p>
<p>It is your penetrating sense of our need and your boundless generosity that have brought from your hand to the Byzantine Institute the much coveted copy of Capitani.</p>
<p>I saw Capitani for the last time in Paris where he died, you know, during the Congress in August 1948.</p>
<p>We must grant the frescoes of Castel Seprio an equal place with those of Santa Maria Antiqua [<i>handwritten</i>: : ] Donâ€™t you think so?</p>
<p>I am certain that Ermolov has expressed to you the joy of the Byzantine Institute in having on its shelves this book for the wolves of learning [<i>handwritten</i>: , ] that come daily to the library [<i>handwritten</i>: , ] to feed upon.</p>
<p>I can think of nothing that I would not willingly exchange for your visit to Istanbul this summer. Do propose yourself.</p>
