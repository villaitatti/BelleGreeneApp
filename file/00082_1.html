<p>Sunday 3. p. m.</p>
<p>Dear B. B.</p>
<p>I was so rushed and trundled about yesterday that I did not have a moment in which to write you but I daresay my letters are not sufficiently attractive to you just now to make you</p>
<p>regret this absence – I “did” museums yesterday – the B. M. in the morning where Read & Pollard took me in hand and gave me a fine time. I lunched with Read later at some club or other and in the afternoon went to the South Kensington to see the new wing – On the whole I think it very good – a bit too gaudy as tomarble staircases etc and a bit impractical</p>
