<p>in town tonight for dinner with a friend who is sailing on the Mauretania tomorrow. Half the people I know have sailed within the past three weeks – I shall probably go over in the Spring again –</p>
<p>I must be off to luncheon now – Don’t feel like you <u>must write</u> to me – [ <i>double underlined</i> : but], when the spirit really moves you to do so – don’t resist!</p>
<p>Devotedly Yours.</p>
<p> <u>Belle</u> </p>
