<p>and found it in much better condition than I had expected. </p>
<p>Ms. Fields sent word this morning that she was not well enough to see me at luncheon and would I come for dinner at <u>7</u>. When I got back here at 6:40 I found a message saying again that she was not well enough to come down stairs. I was really glad as I was exhausted – so much so, that even although I felt a bit lonely I was too tired to telephone anyone and after resting for an hour had a delightfully cooked and delightfully served dinner alone in my sitting room (which by the way is filled with reproductions of the “Morgan” paintings!) Now to bed – I have written in detail – have left out only my love – but every word of this is proof of that – </p>
<p>Did I tell you that Breck has left the Plutopolitan for Minneapolis – He has now gone abroad with Platt for some months in Italy so you will see him – what – a – joy!!!</p>
<p>I hoped you are not exhausted with this lengthy epistle – I love you so much I can never say goodbye even on paper – Belle</p>
