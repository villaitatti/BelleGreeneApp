<p>Jaccacci [sic], I know him very slightly and whenever I have met him it has always been with Fry – He has a most amusing wife whom I have met casually – but I understand they are divorced – I will keep this open until this afternoon to see if there is a letter from you via the Mauritania –</p>
<p>Friday afternoon</p>
<p>You never disappoint me and I have a letter from you – I like it even although you scold me most of the way</p>
