<p>pretty well on the reading but I am not much on the conversation sheet, I hear Anne Morgan is <u>really very</u> much biffed on the Costellano but that Mrs. Flowerdale is her deadly rival. Have you heard anything lately? Forgive this scrawl which says nothing except that I really & <u>truly</u> love you and I want to be with you as I never did before â€“ that is the greatest truth I know. Always <u>Your</u> Belle</p>
