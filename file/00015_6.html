<p>his life was despaired of at one time but he is fairly well now & we spent all that was left of the afternoon there. I have always envied him his Kann Rembrandts, just as I envy Mr. Frick’s & Mrs. Huntingtons – I should love to have the four – Also I should like to steal two of his rugs – a lovely Chinese blue and red and a golden Persian. We had quite a long talk about you – and when I left he was as enthusiastic as even I could wish – He was very anxious to know what my Boss thought of you and also</p>
<p>what <u>you</u> thought of himself (Altman) & his things. I told him I had intended to come with you but that his illness prevented. We had a very hard time getting away – He always insists upon presenting me with a souvenir of some – kind worth all sorts of his tainted money – and has never been able to understand why I can’t accept it – This time I told him that I would never come again if he repeated the trick & he promised to behave – It always amuses me to find how much snubbing he will smile under – the burden of his race I suppose</p>
