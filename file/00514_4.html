<p>I must get to Rome for the Vatican – and I want to ‘do’ some of the hill towns –</p>
<p>I <u>do</u> hope that you are very amusing – and if I find a nice <u>new</u> – <u>brand</u> new – beau, can I bring him along to Florence?</p>
<p>Had a letter from Loeser the other day – and 1 or 2 others of or near your little town – so you need not be swamped with my society unless you want to –</p>
<p>Of course – you know by this time – that I thoroughly approve of your unwithered, but haply <u>transmuted</u> passion – would to God I had the receipt, alter the Heart of me – well</p>

<p>I’d be a very wealthy dame if I wrote to one or 2 others, as often – and at such length – as I</p>
<p>do to you – Mr. 1, 2, 3 –</p>
