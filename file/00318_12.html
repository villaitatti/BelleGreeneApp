<p>Friday 9 a.m.</p>
<p>May 15</p>
<p>Dearestest –</p>
<p>Such a horrid morning! No foreign mail. but the Lusitania is coming in some time today so I shall doubtless hear from you – there is nothing to write you of today. I dined last night with Kennerley & John (& Mrs.) Ryan at Delmonico's, and was <u>in bed</u> by 10:30 so I feel very fit this morning. Read & Murray spent the night with Mr. Jack at his country place they are due about 10 this morning & if they have any gossip I will retail it to you –</p>
<p>Murray does not seem to be doing much of any work at the museum as far as I can see. he spends most of his time here. He really <u>knows</u> (such as there is to know) about incunabula and manuscripts and seemingly cannot keep away from them but as I remarked to Mr. Jack yesterday that is not exactly what he is over here for – I shall close this up & send it by the Imperator. Am having a dinner of 12 and a dance of about 50 at my house tonight & dread the necessary "cleaning out" of all the rooms. The weather is <u>too</u> heavenly. If only you were here & I could be with you – enough this time. I do love you <u>so</u> much Your Belle.</p>
