<p>sister came in while I was just writing. I love her and we had a nice chat. She spoke of Mrs. Gardner and I said “she had a fine collection, don’t you think so?” Well she said, a <u>few</u> things are good, but I think the collection is much overrated” Bella said <u>nothing</u> – Then she went on to talk of her interest in Chinese things and I was surprised and interested. We spoke of the Boston Museum & I puffed it up mightily & begged her to give them some money. She is <u>so</u> pretty and attractive Much nicer than the other sister, Mrs. Crosby. Now I am off to luncheon with Putnam – More tomorrow dearestest</p>
