<p>of a “cave-man,” this young chap has – He has a nice sense of humour and discrimination and ought to do big things some day –</p>
<p>I have just about exhausted any interest in Meyer-Riefstahl He also is sitting in the Hewitts lap and has been engaged in cataloguing & writing-up (for Art in America) the “stuffs” in the Cooper Institute, he has <u>one</u> quality which is that he writes the most <u>fascinating</u> letters (in French) of anyone</p>
<p>[p. 11]</p>
<p>I have ever met. They are simply delicious. Sometimes he writes in Early French – with all its enchanting spelling etc. Sometimes he accepts our invitation to tea in a Francois Villon Ballade – I hurt his feelings by telling him that I would be perfectly delighted if we corresponded entirely instead of ever <u>visiting</u></p>
<p>I’m going to enclose one he <s>gave</s> sent me for the <u>sole</u> purpose [sic] giving me his telephone number. You see B. B. we don’t have in N.Y. men who do such alluring things – although you have that sort of thing every day – so </p>
