<p>[p. 9]</p>
<p>talking to me about Claude Phillips the other day – apropos of an article he had written about Mr. Morgan’s paintings and he said that he was of undoubted learning & the only thing he knew against him was that he was a creature of Agnew’s –</p>
<p>I am knee deep in all sorts of affairs at present & must stop – I am going to Newport on the 5th to stay until the 9th and from there to the Berkshires for a few days – then back here <u>forever</u> </p>
<p>I will try to write you by next Wednesday’s boat –</p>
<p>By the way – I am trusting that you will understand that it is because I really like you that I wrote you as frankly as I did in my <u>last</u> – wanted you to know the attitude of these people toward you – just as I would trust you to inform <u>me</u> in a similar case – & you must <u>never</u> fail to tell me when people are unfriendly to me of course I know I must have [change in pen] scores of enemies but you can understand that I am the last one to hear of them. Personally I am always rather glad to hear of them for it keeps my head its normal size</p>
<p>Don’t fail to write me as often as possible B.G.</p>
