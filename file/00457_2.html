<p>I continually wonder what made our visit in Rome rather wrong – Do you know? I daresay it was only because <s>we were</s> it was rather difficult getting used to one another after so many years – Also at the time I was really pretty fed up with seeing people and Rome – the physicalRome, attracted me so strongly – I often felt that I wanted to be there <u>entirely</u> alone – except perhaps for the Catholic Church, which seemed to me to be part & parcel of it all – but I could very well have done away with all the other inhabitants, especially the hotel part.</p>
<p>The Holy Father seems to have taken me up, <u>since I left</u> – He sends me something via someone who is coming this way every once & awhile. The last was a small ( <u>hideously</u> ) [^modern^] illuminated book of prayers which he signed & inscribed to me – Unfortunately only my maids appreciate these tokens – J.P. snorts every time I show him anything</p>
