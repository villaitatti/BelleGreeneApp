<p>hope you got away to Paris safely – I <u>wish</u> I had asked you to cable me so that I could be assured of your safe departure. I had a letter from Mrs. Strong yesterday saying she was going to spend a few days with you – I hope she told you the reason of her curious attitude toward me. I am not fool enough to believe it was genuine admiration and liking</p>
