<p> <u>July 30</u> </p>
<p>I have just received your letter of July 21 and send this hastily scribbled note to let you know that you are ever present with me – As to Miss Barnes I do not know her – that is I have only met her <u>once</u> – on the Adriatic when I was returning in December – I paid very little attention to her & in fact rather snubbed her as she</p>
<p>[p. 2]</p>
<p>made an unpleasant impression on me – She was travelling with Harper Pennington – that is she knew him & he was on board & he was an intimate friend of a Mr. Lee of Baltimore who was travelling with us & I met her in that way. I did not know who she was from Adam but she informed me immediately that she knew me & then announced that she was La Farge’s secretary & I remembered having some correspondence with her when La Farge was trying to unload some of his truck on Mr. Morgan & I queered the game – forever I hope</p>
