<p>I dined alone with Read at the Plaza, in street clothes & then he came back to my apartment with me and we had a good long talk. You know I feel exactly as if he were an uncle or god-father or something like that and he treats me exactly as if I were his daughter, except I think he takes more pains to educate me and bring me up in the way I should go than he would a "real" daughter.</p>
<p>I was so <u>dead</u> tired by eleven o'clock from having been on my feet and "seeing" all day, that I just bluntly</p>

<p>asked him to go home & he was awfully kind about that too –</p>
<p>Later – I lunched today at the Ritz with a friend of mine from California Josephine Taylor – Mary Knablauch was there and told me a lot about Gertrude & Leo Stein. She thinks Leo is horribly jealous of the attention (such as it is) that Gertrude Stein has attracted to herself. It was a purely gossipy luncheon & bored me a good deal – I do enjoy the men so much more, with their talk & knowledge.</p>
