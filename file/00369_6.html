<p>traveling companion, around Europe to nice, kind, rich and handsome gents – I’d like to travel for at least five years – not continuously of course, but I mean a year or two in Italy, one in France and months in Greece, in Russia – a year in China andJapanand the rest of the time in India –</p>
<p>I must be a freepersonfor <u>at least</u> 5 years of my life. after that I’d be willing to settle down for the rest of my life – My sister Ethel expects to be married in next October so that will relieve me of one burden at least – I’ve felt so horribly old ever since my last birthday!</p>
<p>How this war <u>drags</u> – Noone [sic] seems to be making any advance and the letters I receive from France are very pessimistic; the people there seem to feel that it will be of long duration and that in the end, no nation will be able to claim a sweeping decision</p>
