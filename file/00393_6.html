<p>I have not done any business with Duveen since the sale of the French furniture: they came around for the Limoges enamels and Lèvres porcelains but balked at the price I asked and we could not come to any terms at all – I asked them a million and a half for the Limoges and a million and a quarter for the Lèvres – They almost fainted at the price & finally sailed for England convinced that when they returned I would sell at half the price but they are mightily mistaken in that. Of course there is no other one dealer that I can sell them to but I am convinced that they will realize a very large price at auction and if Duveen does not come across I shall certainly sell them that way – There is a widespread rumour here, that among other things, Duveen</p>
