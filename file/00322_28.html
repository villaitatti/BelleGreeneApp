<p>sincere about them. <u>If</u> he writes you anything contrarious, do let me know. Read & Raphael are also coming – I asked Nancy Furst to invite Murray for tea to get him out of the way & she has done so – Tonight – <u>God he thanked</u> I dine alone at home and go to bed at <u>eight oclock</u> !! Tomorrow, Read, Raphael & I are going up to Mt. Kisco to spend the night & part of Sunday</p>
