<p>Darling – </p>
<p>The little authentic war news which trickles through our jaundiced newspapers is frequent of German victories and advances everywhere and is most disheartening and oppressive – we have all read with much interest and admiration England’s “White Paper” and approve more strongly than ever, if possible, of her stand – but where, oh where</p>
<p>[p. 2]</p>
<p>are her troops in all this dreadful time? I presume they are being held for “<u>the</u>” battle which may be in progress somewhere even as I write. You must be as sick of “war talk” as I am, but so great is the obsession of this devastating struggle that it is impossible to talk anything else. I spent all day yesterday and fully half of the night working at the Library with Mr. Jack, and did not have a <u>second</u> in which to write you –</p>
