<p>that they had practically no time to reply & they gave me these rooms just temporarily as (they <u>say</u> ) they are always occupied from the latter part of October for the entire winter. There is not a hole for you to put your head in <u>here</u> should you come to London & I shall probably have to move somewhere else this week – Did you ever hear of such a horrid mess – Imagine a woman <u>alone</u> (I haven’t even a maid) going to an hotel & asking for rooms – I can see them staring at me now – I’ll have to ask someone what to do – I have not seen Jack yet or even heard from him and <u>believe</u>  <u>me</u> – he’s got to look <u>me up</u> – I’m not going to <u>him</u> , also until I see him my plans are <u>quite</u> in limbo. I don’t know when I can go anywhere or how long I’m to stay. It’s a horrid mess – The weather is <u>too</u> beastly – Cold, dark and drizzling all the time. As to going out of town as you suggested why the very idea seems ( <u>to them</u> )</p>
