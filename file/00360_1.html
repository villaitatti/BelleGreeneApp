<p> <u>Friday Oct. 13</u> </p>
<p>Dear B.B. –</p>
<p>I can imagine your rage and <u>hatred</u> of me when I confess that this is the first line I have written you for <u>over a week</u> – Thank fortune you are 3000 miles away and cannot <u>beat</u>  <u>me</u> . Well</p>
<p>I could give you many excuses – a daily visit to a brute dentist who has callously removed four nerves and consequently made a physical wreck of me – something or other I <u>had</u> to go to every night which did me up the next day and a new job I’m engineering (without any financial return to <u>me</u> )</p>
