<p>tired – Have lost about 12 pounds – and feel physically and mentally exhausted – I <u>know</u> that I put <u>too</u> much into everything I do – especially as 9/10 of what I do may not be worthwhile – although this year I really seem to have less to blame myself for than usual. I have done very <u>few</u> wild and crazy things “after hours” – and – <u>by the way</u> – [ <i>double underlined:</i> did] you know I had been on the wagon – I feel truly desolated that I seem to have only two vicious habits left – the second is cigarette smoking that much for end-of-the-year remorse – I hope</p>
