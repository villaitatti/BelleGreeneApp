<p>10th February, 1933.</p>
<p>Dear B.B.,</p>
<p>I had hoped to sit down and write you a long, cosy letter before this, but I have just been in a whirl of business and so-called ‘pleasure’ for the past three or four months.</p>
<p>I do not believe that you have ever seen our Manuscript 397 of which I enclose notes of the text contained therein. From this point of view the Manuscript has turned out to be very important, the editors finding that it is the most valuable, as well as the oldest by 200 years, of the known Manuscripts of the “life” of Aesop. It is doubtless the lost Grotterferrata Ms. A 33. It is from that standpoint that we are going to have it published by Mrs. Elinor M. Husselman of the University of Michigan and Professor B.E. Perry, of the University of Illinois.</p>
<p>As you can understand, I am more interested in the illustration which I take to be South Italian of the tenth or eleventh century, if it is contemporary with the text which Kirsopp Lake says is of that period, and I certainly would be extremely grateful if you would give me, from your vast store of knowledge, your opinion in regard to the date, origin and relation to other South Italian (if you consider it such) illustration of the period. The colours used are a pompeian pink-red, carmine pink-red dots on the cheeks, hands, etc., The garments are generally outlined in a gray-green, rather crude wash, and the bodies of a number of the animals, similarly filled-in. The rather poor photostats which I send [handwritten: *] you are practically exact size. The illustration has some slight relation to that of the Vossian Codex, Lat. Oct. 15, of which you doubtless have the publication.</p>
<p>I do hope that Mary is in increasingly better health and that you are as well and happy as I could wish you, and that is H E A P S!!!</p>
