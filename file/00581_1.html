<p>Dear B.B.</p>
<p>I have sent you a truly formal acknowledgement of your two off-prints, today, but I want to tell you, personally, how fascinating I think they are. Naturally, I have not read either of them through, as we only received them yesterday, but I have at least looked at every illustration several times, and I am very angry with myself for not having seen the drawings at Oxford when I was there this summer, but although I spent an entire week there, I did not begin to see one one-hundredth of the things I wanted to. I wonder if it would be possible to purchase another copy each of the <u>Raffaello</u> and <u>Michelangiolo [sic]</u> , as I should like very much to have them for my own personal collection.</p>
<p>As you know, anything of mine which is of any interest or value to students, will be left either to this Library, or to Princeton University, so that your books will find a worthy home at that fast-approaching time.</p>
<p>I had consoled myself when I found it was not possible to get to see you this summer, with the firm intention of coming over to Italy next summer, but now, I fear that this is going to be made impossible for either Americans or Englishmen. A small group of us had made the same plans, and were expecting to “tour” the country; that is, the art country. Of course all these difficulties may blow over by next summer, in which case, you will surely see</p>
