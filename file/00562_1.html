<p>Mr. Bernard Berenson</p>
<p>I Tatti Settignano</p>
<p>Florence, Italy</p>
<p>Dear B.B.</p>
<p>This is not going to be [ <i>handwritten</i> : ,] alas [ <i>handwritten</i> : ,] a long personal letter, which I have been hoping to write you for a long time, but which has been impossible because of putting in an average of twenty-four hours a day at the Library since the early Fall, but to advise you that at her request I have given a letter of introduction to you, to Miss Mary Lawton of this city, who is doing some biographical literary work which will carry her to Florence. She is very anxious indeed to meet you, and I think she may amuse you for a few minutes, as she is rather crazy. I believe she was Shaw's favorite actress for his plays. She knows Paul Manship and other people you know quite well. I think that one or two encounters with her will doubtless satisfy you.</p>
<p>Will you please thank Nicky for her letter, and tell her that the Garofola panels of which she wrote me, were given by Mr. Morgan to the Metropolitian [sic] Museum. They depict scenes in the Life of St. Nicholas. I have asked Mr. Whaley of the department of paintings to send you photographs of them.</p>
<p>I was sorry to hear of Sybil Colefaxâ€™s multitudinous troubles, she wrote me that they had really been financially crashed in the resent [sic] stock market affair, also, that she had broken her head or her eye open, I forget which, and various other shocks.</p>
<p>I think of you very often and do really wish I had time for writing.</p>
<p>Heaps of love to you all,</p>
<p>Devotedly,</p>
