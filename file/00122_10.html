<p>I have been wondering if it would be possible for you to come over in late March & spend April and would <u>urge</u> you to do so were it not for this beastly Customs trouble – I am pretty fearful that they would try to drag you in it – especially with the Duveen matter (which looks more serious every day) so <u>daarrling</u> no matter if I should get on my knees & <u>pray</u> you to come.</p>

<p>don’t do it until all this is settled – and I will do all I can to come over in September – I doubt if I shall be able to get away before then – Miss Thurston is sailing on Feb. 22 for Naples & when she comes to Florence I want you to be very nice to her. I will let you know the exact date – <u>of course</u> she knows nothing except that we like each other very much & that you are interested in my art studies & for that</p>
