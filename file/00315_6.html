<p>hardly <u>breathe</u> for the joy of it – Kennerley came to the house for dinner last night, just mother he & I as both the children were dining out – He read to me for several hours – Keats, Shelley, <u>and</u> – Robert Bridges whom he adores. Went to bed quite early and had a <u>horrid</u> dream about you – I must send this off now to get it on the K.W.II.</p>
<p>You must be sure to faithfully report everything Agoness says & does – <u>Especially</u> if it is uncomplimentary to me! It is so wonderful there, the trees & grass & flowers, that I know how far more wonderful it must be in Florence –</p>
<p>Ever your devoted and very loving <u>Belle</u> </p>
