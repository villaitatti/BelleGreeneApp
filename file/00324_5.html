<p>different about Eugene & used to confide in him & Eugene would repeat it all to me, almost doubled up with laughter by the way Eugene made <u>one</u> break for which I am really sorry</p>
<p>Read said to him “do you think she cares anything about me or is she only playing with me” – “Oh no, said Eugene, “She likes you alright <u>but</u> , you should have seen her with Berenson”</p>
<p>of course dear old Eugene didn’t mean a <u>thing</u> by it – he honestly knows how much I like you and he thought Read knew it also – Eugene is [ <i>double underlined</i> : quite] devoted to you – he thinks you one of the most wonderful persons he ever met – by the way I must tell you something funny – you know the three of us (Read, Murray & myself) hardly went <u>anywhere</u> , but that your name cropped up – it became very trying toward the end – Well one afternoon</p>
