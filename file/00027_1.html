<p>Thursday June 17 –</p>
<p>Have just received your letter of June 5 from Florence – and am dismayed to learn of the letters, book and photos that have gone astray – Especially the latter – I have waited for them so long – Have written to the postal authorities here and at Washington – There is one table here devoted to all mail matter other than letters and I always devote one day a week to “ploughing” through it – but nothing from you has ever come to hand – I am going down to Long Island today to spend Sunday & Monday go to Harvard for three days. Will write you either the 20 or 22 – June</p>
