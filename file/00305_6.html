<p>as the one I got from Worch – I have only looked through the Catalogue hurriedly and will take it in the train with me – Goodbye my dear. I just <u>live</u> in my love for you and yours for me – The fact that I love you utterly is attestated by the fact that I write daily. Something I never did before and never expected to be able to do. I remember all your words to me and all your loving caresses & all – your – yawns!!.</p>
<p>I kiss you dear and hug you & pull & scratch that horrid beard – I am – always –</p>
<p>Your Belle.</p>
