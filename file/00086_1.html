<p>Dear B. B..</p>
<p>Truly this is horrible! As you say it is the first time a general uprising of this kind has affected me personally and it has made me too cross & horrid for words – I went to the railways & to Cook’s this morning hoping I could leave by the 11 or 2 train today but they</p>
<p>[p. 2]</p>
<p>each assured me it was absolutely impossible & that even if we got safely to Paris, the train from Boulogne would not take my luggage & that we stood a great chance of meeting with violence from the strikers; added to this were all sorts of horrible tales of derailed trains etc. so that I just threw up my hands and decided I would not attempt at this late date to get to Paris at all – You see it would be very impractical</p>
