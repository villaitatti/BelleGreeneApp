<p>strangely reminiscent (not <u>really</u> – but sort of sniffy) of our Beatus MS – By the way – did I send you photographs of those? </p>
<p>I am ashamed of not having seen the Colfax lady for some time – I’ve been terribly rushed and busy – maddeningly so, I honestly have had no time to go to any of her teas & things or to ask her to come to me for anything – She is <u>very</u> kindly and most intelligent and except that she wearies me <u>physically</u>, I like her very much – I find her restless, merry-go-roundish, squirrel in the cage, <u>endless</u>rushing about, quite exhausting – I dare say that she is better at home</p>
