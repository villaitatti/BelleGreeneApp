<p>more difficult than I had expected. Oh! I must tell you something funny that happened in the Library this morning. I had a bunch of people in the manuscript room and I suddenly heard one woman say “Why there’s the manuscript of Evangeline” – I turned around, horrified, and found her reaching up for a green manuscript labeled on the back “ <u>Evangelarium</u> ” Do you wonder that I am exhausted.</p>

She was overjoyed and told me that she has made all her plans to go to Florence as you suggest, leaving about this middle of May. She insisted upon talking it all over with me and so I told her I thought she had better plan</p>
