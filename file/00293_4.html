<p>idea of it bores me to death and I shall turn her over to Thursty after a few minutes. I really cannot be bothered with the delightful lady in working hours and I really think I shall have to tell her so today – that is the worst of allowing oneself to even mildly like a person – they begin to clutter up one’s immediate vicinity at once – Heard a lot of illuminating and edifying gossip about your friend Elsie de Wolfe last evening. It seems that Miss Brunner knew her and all her doings from the beginning and she told me how the “Fountain” used to come into the Newspaper office and prostrate herself before the editor begging that various serious fits of scandal [^about her^] be not published – I must admit I was astonished – I had no idea she had so replete a past – And yet they try to run in all the dear, harmless, underpaid virgins on 6th Avenue </p>
