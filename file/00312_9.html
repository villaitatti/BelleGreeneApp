<p>I shall manage to get out of the week-end that <u>he</u> & I are supposed to spend there and if I were even smaller than I am, I would not let Read go – If I can keep it I shall not see her again before she sails – It’s long past midnight and I know I have written a nasty horrid letter but I feel that way <u>and more</u> – also I shall always tell you everything I hear about you – It’s the biggest thing I can do to let you know <u>who</u> is your friend & who is not, thereby putting the cards in your hands, Goodnight my beloved – Your Belle</p>
<p>be more amiable and contained hereafter – You can berate me as soundly as you like, when you write and I shall accept it meekly because I richly deserve it – all that I <u>do</u> beg of you is <u>not</u> to let Agoness know of all this & the other things I have written you. She will probably give you her own versions of everything and you must as far as possible sit still & not breathe <u>one</u> word of my reports – but you <u>will</u> write me of <u>her</u> versions won’t you. I shall be interested to hear it. In every instance I have always written you the truth & the <u>facts</u> </p>
