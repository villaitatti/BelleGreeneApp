<p> <u>P.S.</u> There are thousands of [illegible deletion] bits of gossip I wanted and intended to tell you but Im nearly in now & must stop – but just a line about Anne Morgan –</p>
<p>A most curious attitude towards her & her work in France has developed over here – From the day of her arrival, the newspapers have hardly mentioned her & her talks & lectures for her work have barely been noticed by& them – Again & again some person asks me if she is continuing her work & when she is coming over – when she has been here for a month or more!</p>
<p>What <u>is</u> at the bottom of it – Rumour says that she has broken with Mrs. Dike – That Elsie de Wolfe is shaking the dust of America from her feet to live in France & that Bessie has a new loveress – a young actress from Greenwich Village. I saw Bessie at a distance at a French lecture the other day and her partly bosom was [ <i>underlined twice</i> : covered] with medals of all sorts – Really there were ten – if there was one –</p>
<p>Everybody is dreadfully poor except the millions of newly rich – B.G.</p>
