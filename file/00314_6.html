<p>direct and I also want to send you Laufer’s book on <u>jade</u> if you have not yet ordered it – In the same mail a quite lengthy and utterly fascinating letter from Murray, really clever and witty & sort of auto-biographical, such as he has never written me before – altogether a new side of the man to me – He writes me to dine with him the night after he arrives & I may do so – I have taken rooms for them all at a dingy little hotel called the Wolcott. Also two short letters from Read, one of which I enclose – now <u>what</u> do you suppose the catty Agoness has written him? I’ll find out when he gets here – I think she is fast losing her mind – I shall take <u>particular</u> pains <u>not</u> to gossip about you <u>or</u> her to Read & will simply tell him in the tiredest voice I can command that she bores me to tears & that is why I am not seeing her – It amuses me to hear of his plans for a weekend with me – I have not the <u>slightest</u> intention of going anywhere – with him, except with the others to see</p>
