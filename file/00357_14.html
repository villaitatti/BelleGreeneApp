<p> <u>P.S.</u> – My mother is more than ever thevictimof your charms. She asks me almost every day <u>when</u> “that delightful man” is coming and assures everybody that “of course SirHerculesRead is charming but not in the same class with Mr. Berenson”. I attack her fiercely on this point again and again but she will not give an inch which really <u>quite</u> </p>
<p>tickles me – I only hope that her infatuation will not make her want to see <u>too</u> much of you –</p>
<p>I am not bothering with Agnes Meyer these days, so I fear that if you will want to see a lot of her while you are here, it will have to be without me –</p>
<p>But all that we can talk over –</p>
<p>I’d like to kiss your mouth [ <i>triple underlined:</i> off] –</p>
<p>Your <u>Belle</u> </p>
