<p>bigness and grandness of your scroll which I thought I saw there at first –</p>
<p>Dr. Denman Ross has been here <s>and</s> but I was only able to see him twice as I was bedridden the rest of the time since Harvey Wetzel was in town for a week and the child was awfully sweet, holding my sick hand and being awfully sympathetic – we all went over to Mr. Peters on Friday afternoon to look at his Han, T’ang & Sung pottery and on Saturday morning I took Ross, Wetzel and Breck up to see Frick’s collection – they enjoyed it immensely – Ross took copious notes and was extremely enthusiastic. I was quite tickled by your note on our Vivarini in this month’s Art in America and am carefully preserving the numbers</p>
