<p>have lots more to write you I must run as I have a dinner and opera engagement – I spent yesterday morning with Mr. Ellsworth who has a heavenly place in Florence (I judge from photographs & descriptions of men who have been there) Do you know him? – He has a number of bad paintings – but one good Rembrandt and lots of fine books – Had dinner with F. E. Halsey, an old widower of 55 & with loads of coin whom everyone thinks I am running</p>
