<p>I met Miss Thurston this morning – looking very well – I can not forgive her for returning for so silly a reason – Just think of giving up 2 months more in Europe for a silly <u>auction</u> sale of household effects! I have not had time to talk to her as she is leaving at one o’clock for her country home – but we will have a short luncheon together & <u>then</u> (at last) I can hear something about you – my daarrling.</p>
<p>I <u>do</u> love you so much dear – it meant so much to me – a <u>great</u>  <u>deal</u> more than any one (even you I suspect) knows. It is the one <u>real</u> thing of my life and I feel so sure of you and your love & except J. P. there is nothing and no one else in the <u>world</u> I am sure of – And I do <u>long</u> for you dear – I want to see you – to touch you – to talk with you – to <u>walk</u> with you – to put my hand</p>
