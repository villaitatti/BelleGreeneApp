<p>Monday, p.m.</p>
<p>Dearest B. B. –</p>
<p>I am writing this in the greatest rush to tell you that I am almost <u>distracted</u> with disappointment by your wire – You can understand now <u>why</u> I could not make all plans for Paris as I had expected. I am now straining</p>
<p>every resource as to the <u>return</u> journey from there. I can get over with great delay & difficulty – but Sir Montague Barlow, an <u>M.P.</u> who went over on official business last month told me he had to wait <u>ten</u> days for proper papers – boat etc. & as you know the circumstances of my coming here you can understand that I cannot wait to return</p>
