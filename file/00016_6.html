<p>tried to make a philosopher of me – to teach me that “the wise soul uses the excellence of things and so things hurt it not at all” – the truth of which I have not yet attained –</p>
<p>Tonight I feel desolée – some-how even you feel so far away – I have a sense of the miles between us that I have not known before – I can’t even send my spirit “singing through the spheres” to find you – I feel hemmed in – isolated and altogether blue – This I fear is not one that you think you love – Belle</p>
