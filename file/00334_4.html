It is too simple – By the way Read told me that she told him the same thing – <u>he</u> says she is a silly goose I told Read, in a letter, to be awfully careful that way he talked of me to her and not to be too enthusiastic as she would make a romance out of it, at once. I was also terribly interested in the three “she no. 2’s” of Reinach’s acquaintance.
