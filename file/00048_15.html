<p>went out for a dance at Harvard where I felt like an antiquated fossil the boys were <u>all</u> so young – Percy Mackaye took us to see his “Scarecrow”which was performed by the Harvard Dramatic Assoc. & afterwards Prof. Scoville gave us a little supper where all the learned folks discussed the Budget – I was <u>lost</u> – & sat like a schoolgirl</p>
