<p>just received your letter of Thursday noon so evidently the mails are coming through alright. I telephoned the Grants five or six times at the Hotel Bristol without receiving any answer & twice in Paris with no reply. I telegraphed them again last night & twice this morning – but as yet no reply – I went to see “your” pictures at the National Gallery but haven’t the heart to write you about them. In fact I don’t feel like writing or saying any thing – all the things I might want to say I feel I have no right to say & all the things you might want to hear of my giddiness here have lost all interest & importance in the fact that I shall not see you before I sail – Fate is doing queer things with me these days – I feel so forlorn & hopeless but perhaps in the end I will find it to have been the better way for us all – Will you write me soon?
