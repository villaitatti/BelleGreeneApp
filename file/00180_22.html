<p>I loved the catalogue of the exhibition at the Grafton Galleries which you sent me – It is heavenly & there are at least <u>five</u> things there I long to own – When I get rich I am going to buy some Italians (under your guidance) </p>
<p>I won’t be able to stand not owning some very long –  </p>

<p>B. B. daarrling I <u>must</u> stop now and write to J. P.  – I am <u>crazy</u> to see you and it seems a long way off to the fall – but thank all the powers that be – if I don’t get over to you – <u>you</u> will come to me  – Please write me a nice long letter soon & don’t forget no matter how crazy I</p>
