<p>I had had sufficient courage to drop this job in 1913 –</p>
<p>When my M.B.B. died, but I thought that <u>He</u> would have wanted me to keep on with it –</p>
<p>I am determined however to drop it in about 5 years from now if I can find 2 men of the type I want to “carry on” The head one <u>must</u> be English – but the 2nd one can quite well be an American –</p>
<p>Do you know anyone who would do?</p>
<p>What <u>I</u> will do after that is in the lap of fate!!!</p>
<p>I have enough money saved to take care of my Mother and Bobbie <u>in comfort</u> for their lifetime but there would be nothing for</p>
