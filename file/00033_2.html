<p>the matter is <u>hopeless</u> but I think that if he would absolutely trust you – you could make his collection a great one – I made a great point with him several times – of his forming a small but <u>choice</u> collection – the eliminations of many mediocrities for <u>one</u> example of the first quality – entailing of necessity – a large outlay of money. I suggested that you would be invaluable to him – Although he, in so many ways resembles a child, (ill-bred and vulgar) he is at the same time <u>wily</u> & of a naturally <u>distrustful</u></p>

<p>disposition – He is very frank with me because he <u>knows</u> that I have nothing to gain through him – <u>My</u> feeling about him is quite personal – I have snubbed him frequently and <u>continuously</u> & yet only the other day he told someone how much he admired me & that I was “<u>so kind</u>” to him!!! </p>
<p><s>It is </s>But really it is quite foolish to consider him ˆat allˆ except in his relations to his collection – He is so far removed socially that he does not have to be considered in that light at all –</p>
<p>You say you have spoken to his partner (whom I do <u>not</u> know) and to Hobby whom I do know – </p>
