<p>want to say to you –</p>
<p>I have evidently “overdone” my job of getting Mr. Jack to like the Library – because I cannot get him to leave it now – He has been here all day for over two weeks and today he has ordered up all sorts of typewriters etc which frightened me to death. I shall now have to make it a bit uncomfortable for him, for I <u>really</u> cannot have him around all the time, bothering me every minute</p>
<p>My love to you dear – Your Belle</p>
