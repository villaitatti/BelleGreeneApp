<p>sincere, truthful and frank with you and I promise you I always shall be – I shall promise towrite youat <u>least</u> once a week – I can’t honestly promise to write daily for truly dear you have <u>no</u> idea how busy I am once I get back to N. Y – Hundreds of people are pulling me (not for my <u>own</u> sweet sake alone mind you) – are pulling me in a hundred different directions all day & all night & I rarely get a moment to myself. I shall probably have towrite youwith J. P. sitting on a corner of my desk – his favorite seat in the Library! I want you to know that I trust you absolutely and <u>always</u> have since I have known you and I want our relations <u>never</u> to cease even if (which I <u>doubt</u> ) theyno</p>
