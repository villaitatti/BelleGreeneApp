<p>Dear B.B –</p>
<p>It is good of you to want Bobbie and me to come to Consuma – but – the heat – the terrific heat here has laid us low – to</p>
<p>such an extent that I am cancelling the few engagements to visit, I had made, and am going off either to the Dolomites or Villa d’Este –</p>
<p>Venice – except for <u>itself</u> – is not my Venice at all this year – Very few</p>
