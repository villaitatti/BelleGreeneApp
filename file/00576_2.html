<p>the smart shops are doing nothing – One night at dinner at the Meurice, there were only 2 other groups of diners!</p>
<p>Here on the contrary, everything is bustling – Much to my surprise I found this Hotel <u>full</u> – at this time of the year! </p>
<p>I am so glad to be here – the people, even down to the bus boys are such a sharp contrast in their courtesy & self-respect – to Paris.</p>
<p>By the way will you tell Nicky that her nice man did not come to see me, and as I did not know where he was stopping in N.Y. I could not get in touch with him. </p>
<p>Next summer I <u>swear</u> to get to my beloved Italy again – Do Write and tell me all your news – I will be in N.Y. again on Sept. 22 – Love to you all –</p>
<p><u>Belle</u></p>
