<p>everybody is waiting to see me carried to a sanatorium – and I am <u>called</u> a librarian!!! Shades of the profession! – Hofstede de Groot paid us a flying visit this morning. He was naive and</p>
<p>delightfully chatty as always and we exchanged gossip and trade secrets – He came over to expertiserthe Walker Rembrandt (Woman taken in adultery) which he says is absolutely genuine. He says Walker has 300 others all of which are <u>very very bad</u> </p>
