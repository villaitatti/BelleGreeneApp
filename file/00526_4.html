<p>enough worries and troubles (an <u>awful </u>dud of a dumb wife) without your adding to them by </p>
<p>teasing – I’m sure his VIRTUE is very dear to him – and I find that when people have it, they take it <u>very</u> seriously – and as to me, I find it so extraordinary when I meet it – that I begin telling my beads at once- and keep off the grass with a vengeance –</p>
<p>I am sending you a few more photographs and will write you about them from the Library. When you have any <u>hints</u> or information for me about them, please quote the M.S. no. & short title – but, of course once these things are filed in your Library they are lost – Please thank Nicky for her Christmas greeting – I must write to her – even though she likes Marie Louise Emmet much better – but truly I don’t have a minute – </p>
<p>I have to move this summer & it worries me a lot – because I just don’t see how I’m going to afford an apartment – All the people I know who live in them, pay from $20,000. – to $50,000 – a year – and of course I never saw so much money as that in all my life –</p>
<p><u>Do</u> write me <u>confidentially</u> – is it true that Perkins has plenty of money – & when one says <u>plenty</u> – how much do they mean? A million – or 2 million? or half a million?</p>
<p>Do you <u>luv</u> meh? – I’m going to take a [<i>double underlined</i>: last] – absolutely <u>final</u> – fling at life this summer & spend 6 weeks in Venice – in August & Sept – Are you going to play there with me? (but not for <u>too</u> long – dear heart. I’m partly “dated up” –) LUVIN – Belle</p>
