<p>down after Mr. Jack's return. He is in England now but will return in March – Freer says that whenever (and <u>if</u> ever) you come over we will have a week or more with him in Detroit – Mr. Jack gave that part of the Hoentschel collection which was exhibited on the lower floor of the Museum to said institution. It includes wood carvings, statuary & the Biron tomb and Pietá – I worked over him a whole year before he did it and I fear he is still grudging it a bit –</p>
<p>I also "stole" from his Museum the Boscoreale Eros in bronze, the marble bas-relief by Duccio, the Rossellino (which is making me sicker every day) & the terra cotta Donatello – <u>also</u> three Della Rabbia's –</p>
<p>Just had a wonderful idea! I shall ask Mr. Jack to buy Loo's bronze for the Library when he returns – Now I must stop & get back to the job – I have been interuppted [sic]</p>
