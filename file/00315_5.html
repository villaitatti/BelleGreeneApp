<p>think you will have to be an angel and send me another photograph to keep on my library desk at home as I really cannot live for one minute without that thing</p>
<p>Now I am going home to take a nap – I love you more every minute of every day & I think you must know & feel it – Ever Your <u>Belle</u> </p>
<p> <u>Tuesday</u> </p>
<p>Just a line dear to wish you were here on this <u>wonderful</u> day – It is so beautiful that one can</p>
