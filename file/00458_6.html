<p>storing the <u>plates</u> of your two books – I told that I would store them for future use – but he insists upon keeping them until you come over –</p>
<p>I think that the sales will come up in a few years – Sherman spoke of incorporating Perkins articles in A. in A. on Sienese paintings in the U.S. into a book – but the high cost of everything will prevent it this year –</p>
<p>I have twice been told that Valentiner is coming here this fall or winter to go in business with Duveen. I am pretty sure this is true & that its not in order to give him a "standing" that Sherman was asked to make him Editor of A. in A. I am sorry that I must close as it is my train time – For lack of a motor, I am now a Commuter and <u>hate</u> it</p>
