<p>sweet – Dear I have <u>so</u> much I want to say to you – but I have already written <u>far</u> too much & I have a terrifying feeling that you are bored – Perish the thought!</p>
<p>That I <u>love</u> you, you know always – that I miss you and want you to a sickening extent you also know – but <u>do</u> you know how often I am with you, sitting in your lap as I did in those memorable days and melting into your very being – <u>Do</u> you know that? –</p>
<p>I love you dear – Goodnight –</p>
<p> <u>Belle</u> </p>
