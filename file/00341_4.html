<p>the letter from Duveen <u>in re</u> Agnew – Wouldn’t Murray rage and kick and bite the air if he knew it? I was pretty sure that Agnew was about through with him. and I am <u>so</u> pleased that you and Binyon are such good friends – I had told Raphael a great deal about you and as he had heard <u>little</u> except your name, during his trip here, he had, quite independently come to the conclusion that you <u>must</u> be the most worth while and interesting personality in the world today – Hence his great disappointment at missing you – Before Read had received my letter definitely telling him how <u>I</u> felt about you he wrote me “The great B.B. is here, I have not yet seen him, but confidently expect he will call upon me – I don’t dislike him as much as I did, but I am still a bit amused at his pontifical attitude” – Your letters from London have been simply <u>wonderfully</u> fascinating – I have read them over several times and I am not at all disturbed by the Sassiety parts of it – They are <u>just</u> so interesting</p>
