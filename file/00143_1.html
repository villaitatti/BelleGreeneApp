<p>Friday <u>Feb</u>. 7</p>
<p>Daarrling –</p>
<p>This is just a scrawl to tell you I love you – I wrote a 20 page letter to J. P. today for his birthday and I can hardly hold the pen but I don’t want the mail to go tomorrow</p>
<p>[p. 2]</p>
<p>without carrying you a line of my love</p>
<p>The weather here is <u>divine</u> and I am off in a few minutes for Lakewood where I am to spend Sunday</p>
<p>I wish you were to be there to walk with <u>me</u> in the pines.</p>
