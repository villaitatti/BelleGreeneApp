<p>1st June, 1932.</p>
<p>Dear B.B.,</p>
<p>Very many thanks for your off-prints, ‘Les Dessins de Signorelli’, from the Gazette, des Beaux-Arts; for the ‘Quadri Senza Casa, Il Trecento Fiorentino’, from “Dedalo”; and the ‘Due O Tre Disegni di Benozzo’ and ‘I Disegni Di Alunno Di Benozzo’ from “Arte”. We are really perfectly thrilled to have all of these and I am ordering a duplicate set for myself, as I want to read [ <i>handwritten insertion</i> : quietly at home] them and do not have one single minute in which to do so at the Library. I have, however, hastily read the Signorelli and I am perfectly delighted with the Louvre designs, especially the ones you reproduce following Pages 32 and 36. We are most grateful for the new light you throw upon our drawing of the man.</p>
<p>It has been fascinating to look through the illustrations of the <u>homeless paintings</u> , and I was particularly interested in the Salvator Mundi, which you attribute to Giovanni Di Bartolommeo Cristiani, as it is very similar to a manuscript leaf which was offered to me some time ago, and which I thought was a forgery; (the leaf, not your panel!) but as I said before, I really do want to read all of these and so will not attempt to properly thank you for them before that.</p>
<p>It seems aeons since I have been able to write you a personal letter, but the days fly by and keep me increasingly busy. Also, I have had the infernal nuisance of moving from the old house at 38th Street to a flat at 53 East 66th Street, and I cannot get used to everything being on one floor and living in an enlarged railroad car.</p>
<p>I am tremendously glad to learn that Mary has so greatly improved. We were all very much worried for awhile. Do give my love to both Mary and Nicky and tell them that I am hoping against hope to have a glimpse of them this summer. However, if the present condition of finances here continues, I am afraid that I shall have to sit on the front steps of the Library with a patch and tin cup.</p>
<p>Professor Haseloff of Kiel has been here for four or five months, and I, personally, think he is one of the most satisfactory of all the manuscript scholars. Panofsky was over earlier in the year, as well as numerous other scholars from all over the world</p>
