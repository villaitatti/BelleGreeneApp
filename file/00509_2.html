<p>But – even you must admit that I have one <u>saving</u> quality – I <u>always</u> emerge – and in this case I’m willing to wager all I could raise that most women (yes dear – <u>especially</u> at my age!) would have gone under –</p>
<p>That’s why I have not written to you, or to anyone else properly – in fact have done nothing but work my way through the day – and found it overshort for the work – and overlong for me. </p>
<p>[<i>In a larger hand:</i> But now thank God, I’m <u>Free</u> –] and intend to stay so – and I want again to see you and all the people (not many) whom I’ve really <u>always</u> loved in my heart – and they’ve <u>all</u> been so wonderful! There must be some tiny decent thing in me, that they should be so good to me when I have been so selfishly bad to them – and that rather bucks me up for a Vita Nuova – </p>
<p>I wish I had been with you in that Gawamighty Rome – I wish still more that instead of writing me that you had just returned from there – you were writing me that you had just returned from there – you were writing that you planned to <u>go</u> there about April  </p>
