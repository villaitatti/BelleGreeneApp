<p>I am enjoying it is chaste solitude – It’s a great comfort to be able to lock the door on the family – “God gave us our relations – thank God we can choose our friends” – I am all out of the humour for writing and have been for the past two weeks – I have not written a <u>personal</u> letter in all that time except to you – I do wish I could write as easily and as interestingly as you – It’s a wonderful gift Also I <u>wish</u> I could write every day as you do but then, I wish I could do <u>everything</u> as you do – At least I [double underlined: can] love as you do – and I do – It seems as if I <u>must</u> see you</p>
<p>I have so many things to talk over –</p>
<p>My whole life & soul & heart & body to you, you Blessed Lamb of God 	Belle</p>
