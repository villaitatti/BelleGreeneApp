<p>lad of 35, whose greatest asset is wonderful golden hair – imagine the poor youth with <u>you</u> for a rival – It almost breaks my heart when I think of him, for he’s the sort of dear that you would love also – quiet & serious & <u>so</u> well bred and a good, self contained, well informed talker, who has been pretty much over all the world including <u>our</u> beloved Burmale [?] –</p>
<p>Well between him & Francis McComas & Dick Forrest, I have been at my wits end – You must have done <u>something</u> to me to make me attractive for never have I been pursued in this way before – I am sure they must in some way feel my love for you which so fills & thrills & irradiates me – Daarrling I <u>do</u> love you forever & ever & ever & for the day after – You <u>dear</u> .</p>
