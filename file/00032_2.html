<p>bit from our mutual friend L – which I know will interest you in view of what he says concerning the Raphael (?) also I think the description of the collections will interest ˆrather <u>amuse</u> ˆ you – Little as I like him I think he is the cleverest man with “la penna” that I know</p>
<p>In a later note received from him I learn that he will probably sail with the Big Chief – So I can probe him for news sooner than I thought –</p>
<p>I should “admire” to write you forever – but trains <u>will</u> go & so must I –</p>
<p>Please destroy L’s letter (although it is interesting “ <u>evidence</u> ”!) –</p>
<p>Yes – when the fever of love is passed – I shall still love you & probably with more benefit</p>
