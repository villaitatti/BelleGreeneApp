<p>bit from our mutual friend L – which I know will interest you in view of what he says concerning the Raphael (?) also I think the description of the collections will interest ˆrather amuseˆ you – Little as I like him I think he is the cleverest man with “la penna” that I know</p>
<p>In a later note received from him I learn that he will probably sail with the Big Chief – So I can probe him for news sooner than I thought –</p>

<p>Yes – when the fever of love is passed – I shall still love you & probably with more benefit</p>

<p>pretty sure he will let me go if I insist but whether I shall be able to leave him for so long a time (five months) – is the real point at issue. I almost wish I did not like him so much or that I liked him a great deal more It would simplify things so –</p>
