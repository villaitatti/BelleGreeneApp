<p><u>more</u> than miss you – so ache for you and waste away for you – also I feel as if some avenging Hell-Devil, had removed my backbone – I am lunching with Ms. Fields tomorrow unless she is ill – as in fact she expects to be from her letter –</p>
<p>How – about – them – sweats? </p>
<p>B.</p>
<p>Friday morning 9:30 –</p>
<p>I am just leaving for the Museum darlingest and shall send this off at once lest it miss the Saturday boat – It is a vile day – raining cats & dogs – [<i>double underlined</i>: How] I wish you were here – will write again tonight [<i>double underlined</i>: of course] </p>
<p>All my love to you and longing for you – I shall <u>miss</u> you poignantly all today You will be landing tomorrow I suppose – and no letter for yet another week – Woe is me – Ever your devoted</p>
<p>Belle</p>
