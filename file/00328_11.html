<p>beg you to let me know at once for I assure you had I not Fairfax Murray to quarrel with, a good deal of the interest in my life would go” –</p>

<p>By the way, while you are in Paris – will you please ask <u>Rey</u> (at Arnold Seligmann’s) to send me at once a <u>priced</u> catalogue of Murray’s</p>
<p>collection which he sold – Our papers here reported pretty good prices – $68,000 for a Rembrandt etc – I must admit that I hate to have him succeed in anything. I wrote Rey a long letter yesterday. I like him <u>so</u> much – I was supposed to preside yesterday at a meeting of the Federation of Women’s Clubs in Chicago – but as they had unanimously passed a note in favour</p>
