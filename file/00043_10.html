<p>I can write further with it tonight so fare thee well –</p>
<p>I shall be so anxious to hear all about Venice and your emotions there. I wish you or someone could get the people at St. Marks ˆthe National Libraryˆ to publish a catalogue of their manuscripts</p>
<p>The few I know of are so extraordinary – By the way if any of your friends come over here (that is those who do not know America) do send them to me & let me do what little I can for them –</p>
<p>I shall write you very soon again</p>
<p>Your friend Miss Barnes came</p>
