<p>professional dancing was really beautiful. Everybody who was left in town was there and they all got up and danced – in between the performance – Read & Raphael were overjoyed at the quantity of pretty and underdressed girls but I was indeed glad to say goodbye to them both</p>
<p>at 1:30 –</p>
<p>Read looked about 20 years younger when he left and assured me and everybody else that he had never had so good a time in his life and I am quite sure he spoke the truth for we all spoiled and fetted & flirted him to death. Aren’t you glad that you don’t have to be treated like that? The Library has seemed almost deserted today in consequence</p>
