<p>ever seen. Fry is not sure it <u>is</u> Titian & is going to take this young Finn (Borenius) he is so crazy about to see it also Claude Philipps – but Fry says I am the only one besides himself who has yet seen it. <s>H</s> e It belongs to an Hon Mrs. Talbot at 68 Cadogan Gardens – you might have a look at it when you are here – She can keep it for all we –</p>
<p>Fry had a long list of other places he wanted to take me but I was all filled up for the morning & he left me with tears of disappointment in his eyes – & later sent me a <u>five</u> page letter & two of his own paintings ([ <i>in secretarial script:</i> punk]!) for my private collection. I have also been given 2 Persian 15 cent drawings & a small enamel chasse (tres petite) – by the way did I tell you I went to see Wertheimer at his urgent invitation or rather <u>three</u> invitations, by telephone</p>
