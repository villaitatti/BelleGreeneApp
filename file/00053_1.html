<p>Sunday Jan. 23 –</p>
<p>Beloved – I enclose a letter I wrote you en route to Hartford & which for some unknown reason did not get mailed to you – You seem very near in England & when it is <u>only</u> a matter of seven days at the most <u>why</u> don’t you run over here? What a joy it would be & <u>what</u> </p>
<p>[p. 2]</p>
<p>a treat – it would put new life into me to see you & would give me something to live on until the next time I should see you – I have so many millions of things to say to you which are quite unwritable until asbestos writing paper is invented – I am distractingly</p>
