<p>You seedaarrlingI am already beginning a letter to you although I mailed one only an hour ago – This is the <u>first</u> written from “our” apartment. It is not quite in order but I have a desk and a chair and heaps of paper & a pen & that is all I need to talk to you –</p>

<p>[p. 2]</p>
<p>Your truly adorable letter of the 10th – in answer to four of mine which you received at the same time – You have no idea what joy it gives me to know that my letters mean so much to you – I only wish I had the pen ofmenand angels that I might write better andoftener. I <u>love</u> you dear – more & more & in a bigger way every day – Now I am going to answer some of your questions – It is true that the Customs House took some drawings from the Widener’s</p>
