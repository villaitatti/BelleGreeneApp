<p>my next letter. Haven’t you received <u>any</u> of the grapefruit yet? When it once starts it will reach you regularly I will send it until I hear you are leaving Settignano. Daarrling, do you yet know how much I <u>love</u> & <u>adore</u> you? How often I think of you & our <u>joyous</u> days for “je sais l’art d’evoquer les minutes heureuses”</p>
<p>I love you so much daarrling – and it fills me with</p>
<p>[p. 22]</p>
<p>Such joy that at times I am afraid <u>every one</u> can read it in my face – I have lots to tell you of Mrs. Blumenthal & Mrs. Lydig in my next – Get well & strong – [ <i>double underlined</i> : very] dear & love me as much as you can for without your love I <u>could</u> not live –</p>
<p>Did you get my New Year’s cable – Daarrling all the years to come are <u>ours</u>  <u>ours</u>  <u>ours</u> as I am</p>
<p> <u>Yours</u> Belle</p>
