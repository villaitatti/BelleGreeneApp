<p>Florence</p>
<p>Dear B.B:</p>
<p>I am taking the liberty of giving a letter of introduction to you to Miss Virginia White who is on the cataloguing staff of this Library, and whose one ambition in life (really and truly) is to meet you. She expects to be in Florence from August 20th to August 25th. </p>
<p>Miss White has been specially engaged in cataloguing our Art and Manuscript Reference Books and is, in my opinion, one of the best in that field. She is an attractive girl of the wholesome type and if you could spare her even half an hour, it will mean a great deal to her.</p>
<p>Always devotedly yours, [<i>handwritten</i>: <u>and</u>] [<i>handwritten and underlined four times</i>: MORE]</p>
