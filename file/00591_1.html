<p>Mr. Bernard Berenson,</p>
<p>I Tatti,</p>
<p>Settignano,</p>
<p>Florence, Italy.</p>
<p>Dear B.B.,</p>
<p>I am <u>so</u> pleased (and proud!) to learn from Morgan Marshall, administrator of the Walters Art Gallery, that you will, if you can, contribute to the first Annual of that Institution. I broached this matter at the last Board meeting, and it was hailed with cheers, and I was asked to “approach” you on the subject, but I felt that it should be done by the direct representative of the cheering Trustees.</p>
<p>I feel that you of all people should “start-off” the Annual, both because of your long friendship with Mr. Walters and particularly because of your pre-eminence in the art world.</p>
<p>You have doubtless already received a letter from Miss Miner, the editor of the Annual. She is a bright young gal whom I put in charge of the manuscripts and other material in the Gallery, and who has more than justified my insistent recommendation. </p>
<p>Please – please – <u>please</u>, B. B.’chen, give them an article however brief.</p>
<p>I have wanted to write to you, daily for a <u>long</u> time, but daily my life has been simply overridden with things and people. We have an increasing number of readers and visiting scholars here, as well as academic courses (15 weekly lectures of two hours each) and, beside all that, a voluminous “business” correspondence, mobs of general visitors, dealers, et al. So the days pass in an ever-increasing feverish activity.</p>
