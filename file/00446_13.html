<p>him for years –</p>
<p>Breck of the Met. Mus. <s>has been</s> is here and whenever we each can get a spare moment we do something together – I found to my amazement, that he did not know anybody that he <u>ought</u> to know – so whenever I get a chance I introduce him – I took him into the Benson's for tea & he too fell under the spell. Mrs. B. was quite pleased with his aptitude in re the paintings – and I am going to take him down to the Eumorfopoulos on</p>

<p>Sunday for lunch & to Carmichael's for tea where he will meet some of the Museum people – He had a better time in Paris where he had a number of letters. Speaking of Paris, I did not have time to meet Goloub yet – Both Sachs & Breck wanted to take me but I had not a moment – Sachs bought a painting from him & I think Breck said he got something too – I was told in Paris that anything & everything in his house was for sale & that he wanted to meet me for that reason – I shall see him when I get back to Paris – Mrs. Cram told me</p>
