<p>so for one would think that I would get accustomed to itbutfar from <u>that</u> – I need you so much and especially now that I have so much time to myself – there are so many things I long to do with you – read with you – study with you – love you & kiss you & wrap you up soft and warm in my arms –</p>
<p>When will the time come</p>
<p>[p. 12]</p>
<p>when we can be all that we want to be to each other? I begin to despair but then it is a rainy day, and I am blue – I must not inflict it on you – There is nothing of interest towrite you– I have scolded them about the grape-fruit – and hope it will be better hereafter. Daarrling I <u>long</u> for your actual presence, for the touch of your hand in mine & your lips on mine – I love you as I never imagined I could love – Ever <u>your</u> Belle</p>
