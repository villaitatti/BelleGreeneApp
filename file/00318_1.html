<p>Wednesday May <u>13</u> </p>
<p>My <u>Very</u> Darlingest B.B.. [sic]</p>
<p>Today I am made happier than surely any female has been before, by receiving <u>2</u> adorably fat letters from you, the last one of Apr. 29 to May 2.</p>
<p>What a Beloved you are to write daily and <u>so</u> interestingly – and what a full broad and entertaining life</p>
<p>you have even in remote Italy! I am so glad for you – you seem so happy, so calm, so receptively sweet and gentle. The tone of your letters makes me realize (as I had begun to) more strongly how narrow and mean and horrid I have been and how I have allowed myself to become absorbed in little petty things – I shall stop it as quickly as I can & begin this minute to be more like you, my ideal.</p>
