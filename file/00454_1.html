<p>Dear B.B.</p>
<p>I interviewed the people at the Ritz for you today & absolutely <u>nothing</u> is to be had in November, December or January –</p>
<p>The place the McClellan’s spoke of is out of the question as the apartments there are rented <u>by the year</u> – Tomorrow Iwillgo to the Hotel Chatham which is around the corner from Carl Hamilton's</p>
