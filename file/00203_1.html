<p>Monday <u>July</u> 15</p>
<p>Dear B. B. –</p>
<p>I returned from a long and hot trip to Dayton, Ohio this morning and found your first letter from London – I must admit, it made me feel a bit unnerved to see “Claridges” & then your handwriting</p>
<p>It barely seems possible</p>
<p>that you can be there without me – but at least I can picture you there <u>very</u> often – in my sitting room immediately after my arrival – <u>and</u> again after our dîner à deux <u>and</u> the subsequent restless night that both of us spent.</p>
<p>My oh! my how many things there are to remember. I think that if you like me <u>at all</u> this time, you will like me much</p>
