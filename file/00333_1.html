<p>Dearest B. B –</p>

<p>[p. 2]</p>
<p>majestic mountains – I have been <s>out</s> doing out of door things until I am quite tuckered out, for as you know, I have not much endurance & climbing <u>one</u> mountain and playing <u>one</u> hole of golf is about all I can do – there is to be a big dance tonight but I shall try to get to bed early – I wish you were here – just you alone –</p>
