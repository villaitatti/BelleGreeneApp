<p>[p. 4] </p>
<p>met for the first time last week – But believe in my <u>impersonal</u> feeling and non-cattiness when I say that the bedrooms that Elsie de Wolfe has done upstairs are simply <u>disgusting</u>. The first fault must have lain with the architect – for all the rooms are tiny little handboxes, and it was probably a difficult job to do <u>anything</u> at all with them – but as it is they are all filled up with the same kind of junk I saw in her own house – </p>
<p>[p. 5] </p>
<p>little red lacquer du-dabs, little pots of glass flowers, dirty white chairs that I suppose are some period French (they didn’t even look like a <u>comma</u> to me!) fripperies of all sorts that certainly could not have cost <u>her</u> anything but which I presume she installed at great profit. The only decent things were the bathrooms, which were big – in some cases as big as the bedrooms – plain and serviceable – Mr. Frick himself has a lovely bed, sort of Chinese Chippendale </p>
