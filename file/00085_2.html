<p>wire you – I made an <u>awful</u> mess of the Grants. I was in a great rush when their wire came & did not notice it was from Boulogne as I fully expected them to be in Paris by yesterday & so sent two replies one Hotel Bristol Paris (which <u>should</u> have been Hotel Bristol Boulogne) and the other 66 rue Mozart as I did not understand <u>why</u> they were putting up at the Bristol in Paris <u>also</u> I discovered ten minutes ago a wire from Ethel [^G.^] asking me to advance them £100 dated yesterday. It was under a pile of letters on my desk which I had not had time to open or even look at. I don’t know <u>what</u> they will think of</p>
