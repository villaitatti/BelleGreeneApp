<p>varmint! I shall die of shame if J.P.M. <u>really</u> went there although of course my hands and tongue are tied against her. I had a final break with Ethel Grant. I heard she had been gossiping about me and I took the opportunity[,] a dinner invitation from her offered to tell her so. I enclose her reply but I know she must have said what I heard <u>because</u> it was the same sort of talk she gave you & which upset you so much – the trouble is she is nowadays very often under the effects of “booze” & says a great deal</p>
