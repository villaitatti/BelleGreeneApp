<p>It was too delicious – The air was so softly caressing – I love motoring late at night. There is something mysteriously exciting about it even in the most commonplace company – and the party was an unusually clever one last night, all except Johnny Morton who bores me to tears with his scintillating wit – By the way he tells me he is a classmate of yours at Harvard – He is going to take me on a “personally conducted tour” through Boston as</p>
<p>he thinks but I know better! –</p>
<p>I am going down to Princeton on Friday to stay with Mrs. Junius Morgan for the week-end – I had a cable from my beloved Junius today saying that he sails for these parts tomorrow from Paris. He and I are great chums & I am impatiently awaiting him –</p>
<p>Write me very soon & tell me every thing you do and think & say –</p>
<p>Devotedly your Belle</p>
