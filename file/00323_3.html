Of course I feel your <u>physical</u> absence very keenly – but at the same time I have a warming, comforting assurance about our relations that keeps me happy and contented. I wonder if <u>you</u> feel that way – I rather imagine you do – By the way don’t you think for one minute that Eugene Meyer does not like you – He does, immensely,</p>
