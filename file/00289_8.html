<p>short dinner any night, let me know & I will arrange it – When speaking of it he suggested having the young Rockefellers but I told him you were going to dine with them – He seems to think rather well of young John D. I asked Blumenthal about Anaconda Copper and he said it was alright if you kept an anxious eye [^ <u>on it</u> ^] that it was fairly safe <u>at present</u> but he doubted if it could last many years. Also that in case of a panic or any very hard times, it was one of a class of stocks that would be the first to go down – and of course it has not very far to go.</p>
<p>I gave him the devil for putting me into Broden Copper as it has gone down several points and never paid a penny interest. He swears by it and guarantees to make me some money out of it – as I really invested very little (about 9000 thousand dollars) I shan’t let it keep me awake, especially as he does not charge me any interest. (I bought it on margin) It might be a good in-</p>
