<p>In my work it is different for then I understand it does not do to be headlong and headstrong but patient and laborious – “the lyf so shorte, the crafte so long to lerne”– and for my work I have a true love strong enough (even in me!) to try to overcome nature – to try to stifle the quickening of the breath, the heating of the heart in pursuit – which is ruffling and injurious</p>
<p>to the ultimate desire of attainment –</p>
<p>Beloved can you span the great chasm between the thing I say and the thing I <u>would</u> say to you? My inability is most dispiriting to me in spite even of such understanding as yours – and then – <u>desire</u> masters the despondency and I long for a tongue with wings –</p>
<p>How I am revelling in the “Enchanted” Nights!To me,</p>
