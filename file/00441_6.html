<p>P.S – Do you happen to know the (very) slender Desiderio figure of which I write & if so do tell me what you think of it – for of course I may be all wrong in liking it so much. <u>If</u> it came from San Lorenzo I wonder how it came out? I am also "on the trail" of a rather marvellous [sic] Italian picture here of which I know none of the details. When I do, I will write you all about it – I have not seen it yet & do not know even the name of the painter but am to be "taken" to see it next week – Don't forget that I sail 25. St. Louis <u>Liverpool</u> </p>
