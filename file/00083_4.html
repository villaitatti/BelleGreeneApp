<p>art & book world but have seen few grandees – They have just brought me my tickets for Wednesday and I find they are via Folkestone & Bologne [sic]. I have never been this way & don’t know how the trains run but I suppose it is as good as the other route. However I will inquire – They have just told me that it is practically the same route and but a few minutes longer so I shall go that way – B.B. dear, <u>don’t</u> talk of drugs etc. unless you want to kill me – you didn’t <u>really</u> mean it did you? – And don’t talk about envying <u>me</u> if you only knew you wouldn’t – I’m tired dear – I’m tired of every thing and every body which you must admit is <u>not</u> an enviable state of mind – Yours with much affection & all sincerity in friendship <u>Belle</u>.</p>
