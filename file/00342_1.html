<p> <u>Sunday August 2</u> </p>
<p>Darrling – I came up here yesterday to visit my dear old friends, the Truesdales, whom, I remember you very naturally do not like. They have been <u>so</u> good and kind to me – Had a heavenly long soft couch all ready for me on the verandah & I have hardly moved from there since – Mr. Will has been reading “Jan Cristophe” aloud to me while Mrs. T.</p>

<p>was painting (copying a Fragonard, ain’t it cute?) I had read the first two books & so had they, so we began on “Journey’s End” – Lord but it’s scandalous. He ropes every lady in sight and does it down once too, evidently to the complete satisfaction of all the ladies concerned – Then I read them the Books of Job (which <u>you</u> showed me how to appreciate) and they became just as enthusiastic over it as I am – tonight they had quite a large dinner</p>
