<p>was all to the bad – Hereafter I shall <u>patrol</u> (as my small sister says) myself better.</p>
<p>I wrote Agnes a highly loving and lying letter about the same time as Eugene was in the Library and implored me to doso I wrotea good deal about you ( <u>none</u> of which was lying) and told her how much I regretted that she did not appreciate you more. It makes me sick that I enthused about her when I did not mean it and I’m sorry now I helped Eugene outso <s>mu</s> – Poor old Euge has a terrific crush on yours truly. It makes him quite melancholy – I just laugh at him – I <u>never</u> could have a crush on <u>him</u> but like him a lot – but I’m really a bit tired of him now and am glad that Agoness is returning to relieve me – She leaves Paris the 25th. Have you read Anatole France? La revolte des Anges – Highly erotic but delicious literature, I am impatient for another letter from you – Maybe one will come tomorrow so I’ll hold this – Ever Your Belle</p>
