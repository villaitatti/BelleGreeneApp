<p>at the thought of parting not so much because you were going to Wash. & I to New York. no because, it seemed to be the <u>beginning</u> of our longer separation –</p>
<p>I wish I could tell you, or make <u>you</u> feel, the joy and the content and the utter happiness that being with you and Mary there two days has given me – and don’t think I am just “bringing in” Mary – you have no idea how she <u>fascinates</u> my attention – I really <u>force</u> myself to stop staring at her – It may be her impersonal attitude toward me, which causes me to frantically attempt to “getat her” and climb over the wall – which is low enough for me to <u>see</u> over, but too high for me to climb over (Be an angel dear & don’t show this to Mary – it sounds fresh & rude, and Heaven knows I don’t mean either and I would not have her misunderstand me for worlds where <u>she</u> is concerned)</p>
