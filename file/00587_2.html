<p>benefits and not half as many losses as I had expected – <u>howsumever</u> – I admit that I should love to stay at the present age and in the present physical condition, feeble as it may be compared to yesteryears – for about 40 years more! There is <u>so</u> much doing – and going-to-be-done throughout this world –</p>
<p>Now – I want to go East – near and far – next Summer and will if you and Nicky will come.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I’ll slam my first love-affaire down on your head and go off with a rich beau (Another benefit of age – there’s practically nothing <u>new</u> in a damning way they can say about one –)</p>
<p>Love to you both –</p>
<p><u>Belle</u></p>
