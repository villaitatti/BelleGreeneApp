<p>returning from Europe and I dread having them back as they do not give me a moment’s peace – Ethel Grant sailed on the 8th or 9th and the Brunner’s are coming on the 18 – I shall be glad to see them because they can give me news of you – I am going up to my little country place on Sunday morning</p>
