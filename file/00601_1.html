<p>Excerpt from a letter at the Pierpont Morgan Library:</p>
<p>Edward Forbes, Naushon, Wood’s Hole, to Belle Greene</p>
<p>August 1, 1924</p>
<p>…. It was wonderful of you to make the suggestion which you did to BB. I think you deserve a halo, a real 18 carat one, and a harp and all that sort of thing!</p>
<p>Seriously, I do not think much of his Washington suggestion.</p>
<p>I know little about Washington myself, but I gather from friends that the trouble is the lack of a permanent cultivated population.</p>
<p>There is a shifting population of people, most of them knowing little, and caring less, about art.</p>
<p>Whereas it is possible that little by little a centre of culture and learning may develop there; as far as I can see, even the Freer Museum and the other museums have so far failed to give much promise of developing such a situation.</p>
<p>I hope that he will do one of two things: either carry out his idea of leaving I Tatti as it is a place for advanced students, or else as you suggest leave it all to the Fogg Museum.</p>
<p>I think your suggestion was very good that he should make up his mind to give it to the new Fogg while we are making our plans. If through your suggestion he should do this we should owe you a great debt of gratitude for your master stroke.</p>
<p>Why would not it be possible for him to leave his collection to Harvard with the provision that if within one year or two years of the time of his death the income from his estate plus any money that Harvard could raise (in case his own property were insufficient) should be sufficient for Harvard to be willing to undertake this responsibility, that I Tatti should go to Harvard for advanced students (or to Harvard and Princeton if he prefers)?</p>
<p>But that if Harvard was not willing to assume the responsibility owing to the insufficiency of funds, or for any other reason that then the collections of works of art books and photographs should go to the Fogg Museum, and that the income from the property should go to the Fogg Museum as a maintenance fund.</p>
<p>[more details about the possibilities of fund raising if BB should leave I Tatti to Harvard with something less than an adequate endowment]</p>
<p>… if you could write to BB along these lines (in case this idea appeals to you) I think that the best thing to say would be that if he offered such a bait that Harvard might be able to raise the money after his death in case he could not raise it during his life...</p>
