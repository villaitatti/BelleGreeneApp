<p>Dear B. B – Your letter of March 11 – came <u>yesterday</u> – oh! silly that I am of course you must have meant <u>April 11</u> – Your letter both amused and delighted me. I answered your query as to Meyer-R. above, as to Duveen – <u>what</u> a silly you are. When I say they <u>like</u> us I mean just that – not for one instant do I imagine they would allow a mere “liking” to make them loyal or true or even <u>straight</u> in their dealings. How I envy your being in Siena – that Heavenly place. Of <u>course</u> you must come over here next fall – and whatever twice best suits you – I don’t at all think your cowardly Italy is going to war I have given up the Chinese show I hoped to pull off as Freer is</p>
