<p>You have probably seen Chandler Post who went to Italy (as interpreter) with George Baker jr.&others for Red Cross investigation – If he has not done so get him to tell you all the Blumenthal-Gardner – gossip – It would have been amusing if Mrs. Gardner had hit one of her own size, but as usual she took a small child who, not only was ignorant of her jealous malice, but could not have hit back in any case – When the Boston people came in&told me, I sent a message back to her – to try someone more nearly her own size – myself for instance – Hervey Wetzel went with me to her house several times (on pay days!!)&she was just cramped up with rage because he would not leave my side for an instant – We rarely talk of her because he is really devoted</p>
