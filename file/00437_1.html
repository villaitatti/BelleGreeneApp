<p>Dearest B.B.</p>
<p>For the first time in <u>years</u> I feel somewhat rested. Somewhat at peace – and <u>lots</u> like writing to you – I came down to this little Island two days ago to stay with my sister Ethel (Mrs. Oakley) – Do you remember her I wonder? The "blondish" one?</p>
<p>I slept all the first day and night, in bed on a sleeping porch under heaps of blankets, for of course the place is as flat as your hand and the wind just tears across it –</p>
<p>Practically all day yesterday I slept on the beach, rolled up in blankets like a papoose. And today I feel beautifully cleared up inside and out –</p>
<p>There is no one here as I asked my sister not to have anyone over this weekend – She is the kind that loves house parties as big as the place will hold – so I have been spending the time eating, sleeping and mentally "cleaning house" I might just as</p>
