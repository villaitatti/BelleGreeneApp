<p>Later 3 p.m –</p>
<p>You darlingest – It is such a beastly rainy day and I am so lonely without you. I want to hug you until you squeal for mercy <u>you darlint</u> !</p>
<p>Just as I was leaving for luncheon Agoness came in, quite (apparently) radiant and self possessed – After much deliberation with myself and Thursty (the only person whom I tell <u>almost</u> everything) I had decided to write her a letter about her attitude to you and the letter I have written and which</p>
<p>was on my desk when she came, I enclose just for <u>your</u> eyes – I was rather upset by her sudden appearance & was rather short – She started in to talk about Read and the fact that she had just learned (from Freer) that Read had expected <u>me</u> to take him to Detroit instead of Agoness (Perhaps I did not tell you that at the dinner last night she had been trying to arrange to take him there and he had backed-water <u>very</u> beautifully but decidedly, without saying that he was going with me). She told me this morning that she had not understood <u>why</u> </p>
