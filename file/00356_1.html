<p>Tuesday, <u>October 6th</u> .</p>
<p>I received this morning your letter of Sept. 23-25th scoldingme terribly – I certainly <u>have</u> written, I thought continuously and I don’t understand why you have not received my letters – but B.B. daarrling, isn’t it bad enough to be half dead from the terror and depression of this war, without having you pounding me up?</p>
<p>Do be an angel & stop it – I agree with you, that</p>
<p>England is making aballyass of herself over her terror of German spies; Why they tell me of old German women of 70 being held up & detained – A friend of mine who came back on the <u>Olympic</u> (this trip) told me a ghastly tale She said that one of the passengers on board was found and proven to be a German spy and that <u>he was set adrift</u> in <u>mid-ocean</u> in <u>an open boat</u> – I am still sick when I think of it – It seems to me that</p>
