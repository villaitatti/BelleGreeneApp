<p>well and told me most horrible details of their married life – in consequence of which <u>she</u> is a physical wreck. I could hardly credit these tales but every one here seems to know it – S. – hates him – & <u>he</u> says Fry does also but I doubt it <u>very</u> strongly as I am quite sure they play into each other’s hands continuously. This Mr. Brunner knew Miss Barnes and said she was tricky & untrustworthy but he did her the credit of saying that he thought contact with La Farge had made her so. He also seemed to know of her relation to Jaccaci. What an endlessly complicated game this is we are all playing. I think I shall throw down my hand as I am but a poor duffer at it – and there are many other things I must be investigating besides the circuitous workings of alien minds – I hope you had a good time in Scotland. Won’t it be a lark if I can get over for a long stay – I’m rather sceptical however. Belle –</p>
