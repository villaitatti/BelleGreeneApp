<p>back in a week or two – If you have never been in a fire on a <u>freezing</u> cold winter night – you do not know what an awful experience it is – <s>I will</s></p>
<p>I will send you the Catalogue of the rug exhibition at the Metropolitan – but it is only a tiny pamphlet and [<i>triple underlined</i>: please] tell me did I <u>ever</u></p>
<p>[p. 14]</p>
<p>send you the rug section of the YerkesCatalogue? Be <u>sure</u> to answer this – I feel rather seedy & must go out to a luncheon in ten minutes so will stop – All my heart is filled with you – and I am so happy in your love – are you too dear? I kiss you dear & snuggle into your dear arms –</p>
<p>Ever & ever & ever <u>your</u></p>
<p>Belle –</p>
