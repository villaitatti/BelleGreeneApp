<p>Kuan-yin head in stone from Yamanaka for $80.00 – they call it early Tang – they had first called it Wei and then changed the label – It looks to me like the <u>end</u> of Tang – but it is delightful and as $<u>80</u>. is not much I bought it – </p>
<p>Don’t be frightfully cross with me – the jades I <u>could</u> not resist and the head I bought instead of a new hat! Meyer-Riefstahl is mad about the Bourgeois jade but I don’t imagine he <u>knows</u> much about it – but I love it only it does not begin to give me the ecstatic </p>
