<p>fear there will not be many we do not have –</p>
<p>My dear friend Junius Morgan is sailing today on the Prinz Friedrich Wilhelm & I shall ask him to look at the prints after I see the list – I hope you will meet him & like him. That at present he is in poor physical condition – is quite done up by a visit to the desert where he rode horseback – single file for five weeks & he detests riding as much as I love it. So that now he is in bad shape & not very lovable in</p>
