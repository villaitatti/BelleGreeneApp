<p>Extract from letter of Helen Franc to Miss Greene, May 16, 1936</p>
<p>Dear Miss Greene:</p>
<p>Each of several times I have started to write to you, since I left, I have postponed the letter for a different reason. Having just returned from luncheon at “I Tatti” however, I think <u>now</u> is the psychological moment!</p>
<p>When I arrived in Florence I at once dispatched your card of introduction, with a note; and the immediate response was a telephone call from Miss Mariani [sic] inviting me to lunch today at the Villa Berenson. You know I was <u>such</u> a coward that my knees were practically knocking together as I rode out on the bus to Ponte a Mensola! But everyone was charming, beginning with Miss Mariani who conducted me around and showed me the pictures before luncheon; Mrs. Berenson who (exceptionally, I judged) ate lunch downstairs with us; and B.B. himself, who was so urbane, so charming, and put me so much at my ease that I couldn’t imagine why I had expected him to be so formidable! He was quite different, somehow, from my expectations – I think I had imagined him rather more pontifical and didactic. The only other guest was a great Thibetan explorer (“amico di casa”) named Filippo something or other which I did not catch. The Berensons have staying with them a roly-poly young great grandson, aged 18 months, and a wonder “little ice-breaker.”</p>
<p>Well do I know that it was your golden keys which unlocked those portals to me, and I thank you most heartily – it was an experience I wouldn’t have missed for anything! Grazie tanto, signorina.</p>
