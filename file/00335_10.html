<p>R. seems to be recovering from his crush as I <u>knew</u> he would when he got back to his usual routine. We spoiled & flattered him almost out of his wits when he was here & naturally it upset his common sense & sense of proportion – <u>In fact</u> the first part of his letter is in reply to a laughing, mocking and partly serious calling down I gave him for a thousand page steamer letter he wrote me – But as more of all that</p>
<p>he had a long letter from Seligmann <u>in re</u> the bookcover– He threatened & blasphemed <u>but</u> the gist of the whole letter was that he did not want <u>his</u> name disputed and himself labelled as a seller of frauds & <u>if</u> Mr. Jack would write direct to Rothschild, Seligmann would use all his efforts and do all in his power to show R. the necessity of receiving the object without question – so I wrote a draft of a letter for Mr. J.</p>
