<p>The night of the day that you left me.</p>
<p>Desire of my Heart –</p>
<p>To settle to what is before me – the hours, the days the weeks and years without you – is to settle to a dull gray despair</p>
<p>or else certain madness – for I can never cease imagining and I doubt not ‘twil be my undoing!</p>
<p>I make vows not to dream of you – and break them! and then “all the doubts that assail thinking men” come over</p>
