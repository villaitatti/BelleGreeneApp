<p>I open this to ask you a favour. I have been offered very indirectly a collection of presumably unusual manuscripts – mostly French of the XII – XVI cent. – among which there are said to be some exceptional examples of Foucquet, Pal [sic] de Limbourg & Jean Bourdichon – they belong to some man at <u>Cheltenham</u> (name not yet divulged!) I understand that the Comte Durrieu has seen the collection or part of it and I am convinced that I can save lots of time – if I can learn his opinion – <u>without</u> however</p>
<p>his learning of our interest – or even knowledge that the collection is for sale –</p>
<p>If you are in correspondence with M. Durrieu and could learn casually of his opinion of this collection I would be truly grateful to you – If this will bother you in <u>any</u> way please do not do it for it is not sufficiently important as there are other channels through which I can probably get the information. The main thing is that no-one know at present that we are on the trail –</p>
<p>Goodnight dear <u>Belle</u> </p>
