<p>with Freer, the Paul Manships & a few others. I suppose, from all I have been able to read, that he knows more and has investigated deeper into Indian Art, than any one else. Certainly his writings are [^of^] far more significance than either Havell or Vincent Smith. He is much annoyed with me, because I cannot "stomach" his 17 & 18 century Indian drawings especially his so called Rajput paintings. I may be wrong, but I have a "hunch" that he is trying to work up a market for Indian illuminations. I'm frightfully keen about the early sculpture and of course the Ajanta and Charigi paintings but he thinks that very commonplace and "safe" of me as every one else is –</p>
<p>You would have been much amused to watch his deference to Freer. He just bowed down and lapped up the ground before him – I am taking him up to see Freer's paintings on Wednesday & after that visit will</p>
