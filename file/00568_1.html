<p>Mr. Bernard Berenson</p>
<p>I Tatti</p>
<p>Settignano</p>
<p>Florence, Italy</p>
<p>Dear B.B.</p>
<p>On bended knee I beg of you to forgive this typewritten letter, but I have practically no time to myself in which to write by hand.</p>
<p>I loved your New Year's letter and you will be pleased to know that the heavy berating contained therein, had an excellent effect, as, having refused all dinner or other engagements for at least two weeks before it was received, I promptly started out by accepting on an average of two for each night.</p>
<p>A thousand thanks for sending me a copy of your ‘Italian Pictures of the Renaissance’ which I have only had time to read in the last few days. I think even you will admit that it was natural, on first taking up the book, I turned to the pictures or collections with which I was familiar, and was more or less boulversée[sic] by some of your attributions; it then occurred to me, (a bit tardily I admit), to read your introduction and thereby learned that you were adopting a brand new system (you would!) of including works which were reminiscent (I daresay you will hate that word) of the artist.</p>
<p>I also appreciate the fact that it is impossible for you to explain or justify your attributions in that one small volume, but perhaps in memory of our long and hectic devotion you could find time to let me know <u>why</u> our Castagno-Botticelli is nowPollajuolo? I have tried my hardest to understand this, but my feeble and ageing mind refuses to do so. I am also interested to learn that our large panel of The Virgin and Child, Saints, and a donor, had once felt the touch of Giovanno Bellini’s brush. I think you would be still more interested in it could you see it now that it has been thoroughly cleaned, but not retouched except in a small portion of the sky where it had been damaged.</p>
<p>To [ <i>quotation marks inserted in pen</i> : 'me-ow,’] and scratch, I must say that the ‘G.P.’ after our Fra Filippo Lippi would have saved us much money had it been contained in your original letter to Duveen in which you say that it is one of ‘completest’ – ‘unsurpassed’ ‘ranks with the very best of Fra Fillipo’s achievements’ etc. etc. I have always wanted to see a photograph of this painting either after it had been transferred to the Palazzo degli Abizzi, or (and particularly) just prior to its purchase by Duveen. Do you know if any such records exist today?</p>
<p>P.T.O.</p>
