<p>[p. 1]</p>
<p>Sunday Jan. 15 –</p>
<p>My dear – I have just finished reading “our” intinery [sic] for the second time – I read it just yesterday morning at 3 a.m. after a long party – Daarrling, if you were here – or I were there – I should not need to say a word – you would understand <u>absolutely</u>, without my telling you how I felt after I had finished reading – Even</p>
<p>[p. 2]</p>
<p><u>before</u> I had finished – I put it down twice – my eyes were too full of tears and my heart too full of sobs to go on with it and five o’clock found me with the sheets scattered over my bed & some still in my hands, staring unseemingly ahead – I don’t want you to think I did not remember the <u>joy</u> of it all – but oh! daarrling the <u>pain</u> of it <u>engulfed</u> me.</p>
