<p>I do touches you – you have a place in my life which is so completely your own that nothing can harm it – I can’t very well explain all I mean, but I will when I see you – I am afraid you are losing faith in me – and if you Are I am sorry but it</p>
<p>[p. 40]</p>
<p>will not affect my love for you – as you know it was <u>not</u> because you loved <u>me</u> that I love you – for I loved you before you did me – so that even if you put me outside of <u>your</u> life – you will always have the same place in mine – I kiss your dear mouth & your forget-me-not- eyes & your crinkly nose –</p>
<p> <u>Ever your</u> Belle –</p>
