<p>anything at all, really, to do with your decision, please, please come – I cannot bear the thought of the winter without you. I'd make myself cheer up so as not to depress you at all and I'm sure there would be more to see at the dealers etc. than you could see in London or Paris at this time. My little house is a perfect mess but I'd have it pretty well straightened out by the time you got here and you know that mother & my small sister will do anything for us – so that we need not fear being disturbed. If <u>only</u> you would not take it for granted that I have ceased loving you simply because I do not write – but as long as you <u>do</u> feel that way, then I must write. There is not much to tell you. We were all very much surprised by Mrs. Widener's marriage to Dr. Rice. She has known him</p>
