<p>old, for I am happy in being alone here tonight – with a good 4 hours before me –</p>
<p>There are <u>so</u> many things I want to read that I am rather distracted and ache to read them all at once – but have <u>firmly</u> decided to stick to Kondakoff this evening –</p>
<p>I know there are loads of things of which I have not written you – Unless I <s>kept</s> [^keep^] a diary – I <u>cannot</u> remember many of the doings of yesterdays – So – if, <u>by chance</u> [^(ain’t I conceited?)^] – you hear of  anything which you wish explained – or detailed – just let me know and I’ll ‘fess up – My letters to you consume hours of my life and if I wrote of every time that I ate – or what not – I would have to give up my job – Ever Your – <u>Belle</u> </p>
