<p>Friday March 10</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>Daarrling –</p>
<p>A combination of grippe & a trip on business to Washington prevented me from writing you by Wednesday’s boat. I am alright now & so is the business. First I must write you about the Hoe “Near” Fra Filippo – As I cabled you it was purchased</p>
<p>[p. 2]</p>
<p>by Blakeslee for $1200 odd He sold it <u>at once</u> to one of the Standard Oil men whom we approached through B. – but who refused to sell at <u>any</u> price – Blakeslee<s>boug</s> sold it for $2000. I did all the business through Glaenzer who was <u>so</u> delighted to think he could do something for <u>you</u> that he dashed out in a horrid combination of rain & snow</p>
