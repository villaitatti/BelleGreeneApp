<p>10 a.m.</p>
<p>Dear “lamb” –</p>
<p>I am snatching a few moments while J. P. is enjoying hisfavouriteamusement a funeral– towrite you[^now^] as I find my friends in Tuxedo have planned so much for me to do over the week-end, that I may not have time towrite youthere. I have</p>
<p>just received your dear letter of the 21st – Such a nice letter, the kind I love to have from you all about your work and play – and me – (I don’t quite know which of those headings I come under) First about Duveen – Much as I hate him I really feel he has been treated [ <i>double underlined</i> : outrageously] and J. P. feels the same. We talked about it at length the evening of my arrival</p>
