<p>Which I recently bought (in a pair of 9) from Austria. I would not bother you with photos of another <s>Greek</s>  <u>late</u>  <u>Greek</u> MS. except that this is <u>very</u> unusual in having the text entirely in Cruciform  â€“ The fool photographer made a mistake and copied numerous purely textual pages</p>
