<p>and have virtually been out of the world for three or four months – That is all the explanation I can give you – a pretty poor one I admit, but true. I have not had any vacation at all and I'm about the most complete nervous wreck you can imagine – I thought and hoped that when I got back to N.Y. from the tiresome and monotonous little seashore place where I spent the summer that life would begin properly once more but I came back to find the little house I had taken in a perfectly horrible mess of painters, paperhangers electricians and such and I am living in the worst mess you can imagine – The floor of my bedroom is piled to the ceiling with books as they are still working in my library room and we are obliged to take all our meals at an hotel – You can just bet that all this does not <u>add</u> to the sweetness of my disposition</p>
