<p>Under Cosimo Tura, in my North Italian Painters, I spoke of the keen joy there was in contemplating existences as convincingly real as ourselves, but made of infinitely more obdurate material and therefore of endlessly greater resistance â€¦ Well, you get a kindred pleasure out of Indian Sculpture, but at the exact opposite. The existences in this art are softer, <s>subtler</s> [^more supple^], more pliant, more elastic than we are. They are as convincing as the heroic Tura and Piero della Francesca, but can relax, get into positions, throw their limbs about, in a way endlessly beyond what even our acrobats dream of attempting. The natural result is that Hindu sculpture, alone of all the arts, is in its very essence, quite apart from any question of subject-matter, sensual. If <s>you</s> [^we^] unconsciously mime, as we necessarily do, what we contemplate, we find ourselves, in the presence of these Indian figures, relaxed, deliciously stretchy, in a physical condition so soft that the least inclination lights up the erotic spark and fans it into a blaze. That is why Indian art is the only monumental art known to me that is frankly and simply erotic. The sets represented would elsewhere be sheer pornography, and of the worst, because our art, after all, is endlessly nearer Tura and Piero, with their hardness and rigidity, than it is to the swooning, luscious Indian art, which not only permits but insists that form shall melt into form and limb cling to limb. Our art, at its worst, is a better instrument for the representation of the ascetic than of the sensual.</p>
