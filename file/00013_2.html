<p>lunching (at the Colony Club, by the way, where I saw several of your devotees!) hearing a bit of Kitty Chatham & dashing for the train. Mrs French brought a small party of us down here to open her house for her. Alas we found the house not ready to be opened & had to come over to this hotel where we stay until tomorrow</p>
