<p>by the minute, I was <u>really</u> furious and said that <s>it</s> all I could say was that it was a poor commentary on herself – then she burst out with “Well, many other people by no means have such an exalted opinion of B.B. as yourself.” said I – that way be, but they are doubtless people who don’t count in any way, for I know, or know of most of the people who <u>do</u> and I know what their opinion is” – I <u>was</u> in a rage and could have gladly slapped her face – Then said I, “If you think all this about B.B. I don’t understand how you can go to Florence <s>and</s> purely on his account” Oh! she said, <u>I</u> did not ask B.B. – he <u>implored</u> me to go to Florence – I was awfully afraid that I would be bothered by his wanting to show me things all around and probably wanting me to buy things and I was much relieved to have him say that he did not intend to do so – he little knows that I have seen <u>everything</u>!!! in Florence years ago – etc. etc. </p>
<p>Well B.B. – I never pretended to be an angel and as you know, I never interested myself in her </p>
