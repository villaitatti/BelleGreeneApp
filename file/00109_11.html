<p>you twice a week – I really will but you <u>know</u> how I hate, loathe & abominate writing letters, don’t you love? – I have bought Bland’s book on China under the Empress Dowager but daresay I shall <u>never</u> live to finish it – [ <i>quadruple underlined</i> : Daarrling] how could you <u>ever</u> do it –Lordbut you have time & patience & oh! Yes “scholarship” – Preserve me from it dear Lord! –</p>

<p>I am going to see “Sara” in Judas & Phedre tonight & on Sunday she is coming to my tiny flat for a small & <u>see</u> lect party – Daarrling I love you & love you & love you – Don’t forget it for a moment & don’t ever let me go – Hold me tight dearest – I want so much to be wrapped in your heart & in your arms – And I have faith & know it will not be long now – <u>Your</u> Belle –</p>
