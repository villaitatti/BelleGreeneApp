<p>In writing the above, I forgot about the Coptic manuscripts and that I want you to see them. I'll write to Hyvernat & tell him to arrange that there will be no difficulty about that – I have word that I am to be received in private audience by the Pope. I did laugh when I read the letter – I'm quite nice to that old, wily pro-German & if he thinks he is going to get anything <s>of</s> out of <u>me</u> , he is entirely mistaken; but I can play the game as long as he can – I am continually</p>
<p>asked about Carl Hamilton here and always as if he were some sort of a travelling circus – I just say that I hardly know him at all which is perfectly true, but any spiteful & vindictive self gets in many a punch at Duveen through him. It <u>is</u> really a shame, because noone [sic] knows <u>him</u> , but they all know that Duveen has him tarred & feathered so they take it for granted that is some kind of an imbecile –</p>
<p>If it were not for Duveen & the disgusting grip he has on him, I would try to say something in his (Hamilton's) favour – as it is, I decide</p>
