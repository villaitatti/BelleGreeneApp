<p> <u>Tuesday May 9</u> </p>
<p>Daarrling</p>
<p>I received yesterday the <u>adorable</u> little painting</p>
<p>It had been in the Customs House so long that I was beginning to despair of <u>ever</u> receiving it. I <u>love</u> it dearly and shall put it beside my bed as you suggest.</p>
<p>How splendid the colouring is and how majestic the Virgin. I am <u>so</u> thrilled to have it for my very own â€“ just think I now have <u>two</u>  <u>real</u> paintings. It is so extraordinary to have something given me that I really adore. I have a whole room downstairs that is almost filled with stuff people have given</p>
