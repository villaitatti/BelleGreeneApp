<p>talk over with my Boss in a quiet hour – I am filled with excitement at the prospect of seeing my dear J.P. in two days – or less. It seems as if he had been away for ever – He sent me an adorable wireless and if I did not know him so <u>very</u> well – I should have been quite convinced that he had shaken the adorable dust of London from his feet <u>simply</u> because he could not stand another single minute away from me! But alas! for my vanity – I know all too well why he returns just now – In any case I shall have the great joy of his return – He is one of the all too few things in life that live up to ones hopes expectations & imaginations – My joy</p>
<p>in his presence is always just as great (and each succeeding year a bit more so) as I imagined – he immediately wraps one so to speak within the comfort of his own personality & storms blow all around one but <u>never</u> touch one – I quite love him –</p>
<p>Again I have written you a disgustingly long letter – I’m sorry – Beloved I have such a nasty trick of loving some people <u>more</u> in their absence – that I wonder how it will be with us i <s>f</s> when, if ever, we meet again? – <s>Have</s> What a joy it would be to simply melt into each other without a word! –</p>
<p> <u>Belle.</u> </p>
