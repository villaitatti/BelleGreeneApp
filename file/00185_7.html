<p>You were <u>so</u> sweet to care about my sister’s illness – I think I wrote you that we had to send her back to the Hospital a week ago Sunday – We feared that an immediate operation might be necessary but they are putting it off as long as possible as they consider her pretty young for an ovarian operation, of course we may have to have one yet, but we are hoping against hope</p>
