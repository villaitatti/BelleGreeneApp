<p>Museums – I hear that Cleveland has some good Chinese things and I want to go with <u>you</u> to see Laufer in Chicago and Freer (of <u>course</u> ) and the Minneapolis show – So <u>if</u> you come over (and you <u>must</u> ) keep a week or two open for such a trip. It will be lots of fun and I'm so old and have sunk</p>
<p>into such insignificance that nobody bothers to scandalize about me any more – It's sad to reach that age, isn't it?</p>
<p>––––Later 3 p.m –</p>
<p>I have just come from Bahr's show – All of his paintings are atrocities but he has some excellent pieces of Sung pottery (for which he is asking 5 and 6 thousand dollars apiece) and some fairly good pieces of early jade</p>
