<p>most of this month and next – therefore that I may receive news of thee continually and in good season – mark thy missives [in secretarial script: Personal] – and they will be forwarded to me – I shall be moving around pretty much all over the Eastern parts of the country and so cannot give you a permanent address. – on Tuesday we are all going up to Harvard to see Maude Adams presentation</p>
<p>of Joan of Arc & to stay over for the graduating festivities until Saturday – then I go to Tuxedo until the following Tuesday – (to break that horse!) Early in July weI am invited for a motor tour through the Berkshires – my plans are not quite in order after that but I will write you –</p>
<p>Beloved – I cannot imagine what has become of the letters & packages that went astray</p>
<p>It must be that La Blonde</p>
