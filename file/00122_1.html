<p>[ <i>written on left of page</i> :II] Thursday 8 p.m –</p>
<p>Jan. 19th –</p>
<p>Daarrling – Here I am again in bed and again – writing you – I don’t wish to “bray” but I’m doing pretty well I think to give up all dinners & parties & come home to bed <u>two</u> nights in succession – I had <u>two</u> lovely letters from you today – written from Jan. 2-7 –</p>
<p>My letters seem to reach you much quicker than yours do me</p>
<p>The first thing I am going to do is to answer all your questions – I have sent the directions about the grape fruit to Charles & Co – I am <u>appalled</u> to learn they are just reaching you – <s>they</s> of course they will not be fit to eat – They ought to reach you quite regularly now as I send them about every ten days – but if they are not good let me know & I will try Hicks although Charles is accredited with being the best firm here for that –</p>
<p>And I <u>have</u> received the photographs</p>
