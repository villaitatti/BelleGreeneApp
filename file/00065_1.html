<p>Tuesday <u>April</u> 19th</p>
<p>[Underlined multiple times: Dear] – I feel like calling you all sorts of extravagant <u>sounding</u> names – I love you So very dearly & truly and <u>increasingly</u> . I have only <u>two</u> minutes for writing now as I want to catch a train for Philadelphia</p>

<p>shortly –</p>
<p>So many thanks for the picture which I love and yet it is not the <u>you</u> I have snuggled away in heart’s memory – you so glowing, so quick, so sensitive & so responsive –</p>
<p>I never met any one who seemed to <u>commune</u> </p>
