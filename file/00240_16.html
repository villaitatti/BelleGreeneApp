<p>racked by thoughts of my J.P. –</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure he knows now how much I loved him – Do take <u>all</u> care of your health B.B. dear, I can’t <u>bear</u> to have you feel so <u>frail and limp</u> all the time. If you come over in the Fall, I am going to make it my business to send you back in good shape –</p>
<p>I think that you and only you can revive</p>
