<p>Friday Feb. 10 –</p>
<p>Daarrling –
I am writing this in bed as I am done up by a horrid cold I caught last night and feeling <u>most</u> “misable” – I went to a dance that was given for the visiting Englishmen</p>
<p>[p. 2]</p>
<p>to the Gould-Decies Wedding and got home at 4 a.m. & feeling rather punk took a bath & then slept as I always do, in a room with the windows all open – and awoke with my head buzzing – & unable to speak – I am now taking alternate doses of whiskey and quinine</p>
