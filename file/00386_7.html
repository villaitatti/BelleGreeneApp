<p>Now as to the so called Bellini circumcision (of which I am sure I lent you a photograph) I am terribly amused at what you say in your letter, for when you and Mary were here I told you both again and again how much I loathed hated and despised it & you both said it was not so bad as I claimed (although of course no relation to Bellini) I personally think it too horrid to be a forgery. If you do not mind I should <u>very</u> much rather you ignored it entirely as I expect </p>
