<p>going over N.Y. with all this German talk – It makes me tired – He feels that the Kaiser made his one mistake by going into Belgium – That it he had waited one day, France would have done it and Germany would have retained the world sympathy – He was <s>clo</s> cold and damp like a fish and hard as steel. <u>What</u> a deadly enemy he would be – </p>
<p>We are all dismayed and dumbfounded by the destruction</p>
<p>[p. 12]</p>
<p>of Rheims. I, for one, can hardly credit it – and I cannot bear to write of it – </p>
<p>Goodbye for today dearest – I hope to have a letter from you on Thursday – I do pray that you will be able to come over – even if not until December.</p>
<p>All my love to you and a <u>hurting</u> hug – </p>
<p>Your </p>
<p>Belle.</p>
