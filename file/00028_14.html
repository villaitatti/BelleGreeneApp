<p>sure that the bust in question did not come from Seligmann that is, if you mean the small, terra cotta “Cavalieri” affair – I don’t like to have Seligmann at cross purposes with you – for although of him as a person one cares nothing in fact is oblivious – as a dealer I have more faith in him than in most of the others. When I see him I am quite sure I can straighten the whole matter out – but I don’t like to interfere at this distance for fear of mixing things more.</p>
