<p>then for Mrs. Gardner – so I held <s>him</s> [^you^] over his head and he swears by all the saints & the fact that I need not pay until I am ready that you would have been “wild” about it – but I’m not sure at all – I <u>know</u> you would <u>like</u> it – but I am not sure that you would have bought it – now are you simply disgustedly <u>furious</u> with me darling? If you are for Heaven’s sake tell me and don’t attempt to console me</p>
<p>[p. 8]</p>
<p>My only consolation (slight as it is) is that I am <u>certain</u> that I could not be so mad about it, without finding an answering (if dim) spark in you. I will have it photographed if I decide to buy it – no more now – I must run – Will take this to Boston & send it by Saturday’s boat –</p>
<p>Your adoring adoring </p>
<p><u>Belle</u></p>
<p>Later 7 p.m. – in the train.</p>
<p>Well you angel face – here I am within three hours </p>
