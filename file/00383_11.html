<p>name – speaking of Germans – I met an awfully interesting family named E. A. Kraftmeier – He is of German birth but has been a naturalized Englishman for 20 years – she is English and I think some sort of relation to Mrs. Asquith via Sir Charles Fernand. She avers that the story of the German spy governors in the Asquith household is true. He seems to be the <s>biggest</s> head of the biggest concern in the world for the manufacture of smokeless powder and all</p>
