<p> <u>Monday Sept. 21</u> </p>
<p>Daarrling – I had a very hectic Sunday in the country – Had breakfast with the Whitmans in Fairfield Conn. lunched with the Truesdale’s in Greenwich & dined with Jack Cosgrave inBelle Haven – Everywhere I went I was appalled to find <u>pro-Germans</u> and when they were [^not^] exactly pro-German they were <u>anti</u> - <u>English</u> – at Jack Cosgraves I met Lincoln Steffens (retired muckracker)</p>
<p>and Gerald Stanley Lee, whom I think you met in Northampton [sic]. They both criticized England very freely & said they would prefer German domination to English – they recited tales of English atrocities in South Africa and other places & proved, at least to <u>their</u> satisfaction, that England’s one idea was <u>to grab</u> – expansion to speak more decently – so many people over here seem to be coming to the conclusion that the Kaiser did all he could to preserve peace but that Russia absolutely refused all & every overture – Junius</p>
