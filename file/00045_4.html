<p>Wednesday to the Philharmonic</p>
<p>Thursday the New Theatre again for a new play by Eddy Knoblauch – a miserable tiresome thing and tonight I have just returned from dinner with the Gilders – besides my days have been distracting almost maddening – Langton Douglas is over here & has paid us two visits. He is a slimy fat podgy & seemingly guileless person whom I loathe & treat accordingly.</p>
