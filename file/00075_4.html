<p>August and I would feel very badly to have you lose that as you must need it greatly. I shall be glad to get away for awhile although my conscience reproaches me for leaving the Big Chief – he looks <u>so</u> pathetic when we talk about it – but I am very tired & very nervous & every one say <u>very</u> </p>
<p>disagreeable – but the minute I get on board ship I shall forget all that and think only of you – I can’t quite believe I am really going to see you again and I am sure we will have to go through the ceremony of getting to know each <u>other</u> all over again</p>
<p>Your Belle</p>
