<p>Thursday <u>Dec.</u> 29 – 1910</p>
<p>Dear Daarrling –</p>
<p>I am <u>so</u> rich – so <u>very</u> rich for I have two delightful long letters from you – one received last night & one received today written Dec. 12th – You poor Daarrling your letters <u>never</u> come to me</p>
<p>[p. 2]</p>
<p>by the boat you designate</p>
<p>Isn’t it <u>wicked</u> of them! This one was marked Lusitania & should have reached me on the 23d – instead of today the 29th – What <u>devils</u> those Italians are – I <u>love</u> your letters daarrling even if </p>
<p>you are so desperately ill – I haven’t talked much about your “sickness” in</p>
