<p>show you <u>why</u> I have such faith in them & a few of the reasons for my devotion to them – <u>My</u> reasons are of course <u>very</u> definite, but do tell me, what reason (if your interpretation of them is correct) has J.P. – the Vivian Smiths (as far as I can learn, of the [ <i>double underlined:</i> most] conservative & best in England) the Grenfell's who seem to consider themselves at home only with the Devonshires & the Royal Family – and then such</p>
<p>people as the <u>very</u> dear Eumorfopoulos, Read, (who has been one of the staunchest & most unwavering friends of my life) and who always puts me wise when he thinks any one would try to "use" me in any way – the Ionides, Cecil Smith etc. etc. All these "minor" (??) people are simply <u>devoted</u> to the Benson's & at a dinner at the Eumos last Monday twelve of us, including the above just nearly raved about them for several courses.</p>
<p>So do tell me dear B.B. –</p>
