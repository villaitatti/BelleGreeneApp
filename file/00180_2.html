<p>beloved you, that you liked the photographs – As you say, they <u>are</u> mine own self, poor, indifferent and bad – I hope the smoking one particularly appealed to you – Baron de Meyer, who is having a show here and whose work I admire <u>immensely</u> </p>
<p>is going to take one of me on Thursday & if at all like me, I will send it to you – They are a messy lot, he and his wife, but he does good work – and for that reason we are on speaking terms – Your friend Mrs. Baldwin came to see J. P. before</p>
