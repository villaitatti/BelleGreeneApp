<p>you – without avail for you are always there – the background of my days and nights. I suppose that in the course of human nature (my human nature & yours) and if you stay away from me long enough that I will forget you and you will forget me – and that we both will go our separate ways – you the path of fame and glory – I the path of all “sordid victims”</p>
<p>You bid me close prating of my love for thee & instead tell you minutely the sordid happenings</p>
