<p>that of the German advance into Belgium with hisses – It was the same in two or three vaudeville houses we stopped in for a minute where they showed moving pictures of the various armies etc. I never heard such a wild roar of rage and disgust as broke out when a portrait of the Kaiser was thrown on the screen & they had to take it off pretty quick – Portraits of the king of England and the French army were given prolonged hand-clapping & cheers – I’d certainly hate to be a German in this town at present – everywhere the streets & street corners are blocked by bunches of arguing men. It is all very quiet and orderly now but it would not take much to stir up a riot – The American <u>men</u> are all anxious to get in the fray & fight with England – The press is so strongly anti-German that Münsterberg and a few other Germans have come out in violent protest – but they cannot change the general feeling – The only safe ships are the American liners so the mail will not reach you as promptly as usual – I am much concerned about you and am anxiously awaiting news –Your Belle</p>
