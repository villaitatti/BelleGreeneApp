<p>of the boats and noone knows if <u>anything</u> will sail tomorrow – I enclose part of a letter <u>just</u> received today from Read – You won’t mind the “love” & “darling” & stuff – because <u>I</u> don’t – If it gives him any joy in his declining years to like me let him steam ahead it doesn’t hurt us – I think the letter I wrote him removed a great deal of his jealously [sic] & how he can see you with a fair mind – <s>I wrote</s> I must say that I shall be <u>furious</u> with you if you gave him the satisfaction</p>
