<p>Lodge took me downstairs to the store room , and showed me a set of the “Rokan” which were very charming – and another “Rokan” by a man I never heard of, but when Lodge says I must remember “Rikushinshu” I don’t think that spelling is quite correct but that is exactly as he pronounced it – some “Sino-Thibetan” paintings of which I had never heard of before, a delicious, but slightly <u>mannered</u> roll by Sung Yuan, some fan shaped paintings, the one I liked best he said was by Li-Cheng, 10-11 cent. – and was a great big landscape in a very small space – I cannot remember all the others – I did not like so awfully, those he called Japanese –</p>
<p>It was after one then and he asked me to lunch with him which I did in the building – afterwards he took me into the room of Persian illuminations <u>what truck</u> !!!, almost the <u>very</u></p>
