<p>of the time I spent at the Homestead was with him, golfing or talking or riding in his automobile (a beauty by the way which I almost learned to drive before I came away) and my friends (??) have given me to understand that in consequence of the above “people talked” – Damn them! But of course I should have known better and it is out of exceeding humbleness of my heart that <u>confiteor tibi</u> . Headlong was I born and</p>
<p>headlong I continue precipitously rushing forward through all manner of nettles and briars instead of keeping to the path – guessing at the meaning of unknown words instead of looking into a dictionary – tearing open letters and <u>never</u> untying a string expecting every thing to be done in a minute and the result is that I fall & scratch myself to pieces without accomplishing <s>any more that</s> ˆas much asˆ the Burne Jones angels who spend their time decorously wandering up and down stairs in immaculate robes.</p>
