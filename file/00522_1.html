<p>Dear B.B –</p>
<p>I have been up to Manchester for the Labor Day holidays – and am writing this on the way back.</p>
<p>I had your letter saying that you were going to Germany & Austria the day I left – Friday – and envied you for a long time – I think I was born to be a vagabond – for I continually ache to pack a bag and be off – It doesn’t matter where; so </p>
