<p>shocking time getting to the Stadium; as they would not allow our (or any) automobiles to go across the bridge and we all had to get out and walk – imagine in evening clothes & three inches of heel! – And then the excitement of finding ones car after the performance would have been funny, were it not ghastly –</p>
<p>But nevertheless we all had a bally good time, we stayed over until after class day on Friday & you never saw a more completely exhausted human being than I was on Saturday – We spent most of the day at “spreads” – the Hasty Pudding in the morning, Pi Eta in the gymnasium & the nicest of all – the Book Spread in the late afternoon in their lovely Hall – They had the Class Day exercises in the stadium – and the Joan of Arc</p>
