<p>any which may be cropping up – as she & Joe Duveen – have struck up quite a friendship she could buy them through him – He got a very fine early wood ceiling for her and as I prophesied long ago I think she will turn more & more from Seligmann to the Duveens –Glaenzer <s>has been</s> is over here but he has been quite ill and in the Mt. Sinai hospital for three weeks – he told me when he first arrived that Seligmann had given him no stuff to bring over & that he (Seligmann) feels that the conspiracy against him over here is too strong to break down – I think <u>S.</u> is pretty well down and out from a business standpoint</p>
