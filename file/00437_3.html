<p>that I'm <u>not</u> the typical aunt in this respect, although I am in all others – But the doctor who pulled him out, the baby specialist and all the men who know about babies are all very much excited about him – In my opinion he'll either be a prodigy or a "bad un" – The gripping fact (to me) is that his head is shaped almost bone for bone like my Mr. Morgan's</p>
<p>I showed Dr. Dennett the death mask of Mr. M. beside the baby's head and he was dumfounded [sic] – When he recovered sufficiently to more than gasp, he said, "Now, if he had been <u>your</u> baby etc etc!" –</p>
<p>All of the above leads to what I have been thinking for the past few days, which is, <u>why in Hell </u>have I been such a fool as <u>not </u>to have a baby?</p>
<p>I never thought of it before this young fellow arrived (he is now 8 months old) but I have thought of practically nothing since – and I shall most probably, not (<u>really</u>) think of</p>
