<p>Sunday midnight</p>
<p>B.B. darling – I have come to the conclusion that my eyes are out of joint as I simply cannot throw off this blinding headache which prevents me from sleeping yet makes me hate to be up and about – there is little to chronicle but such as it is I give you –</p>
<p>I went to luncheon on Saturday with Agoness and Eugene – at their house – I was aching in my upperstoryanyhow and Agoness and some new stuff she has bought by a man (an idiot & lunatic) named Brancusi got on my nerves and I’m afraid I was horrid. The stuff was dirty punk – the thing she raved about a large pot-bellied bronze bird, a very poor but direct copy of Sassanian [sic] work – and the small head of a girl too filthy even to talk about – It made me sore to think that anyone I knew could like and buy such cheaply sensational rubbish and I told Agoness it made me ashamed to know her. That, as you may imagine did – not start us off any too pleasantly</p>
