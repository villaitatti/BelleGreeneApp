<p>no power to alter my feeling for you one iota</p>
<p>I love [ˆyouˆ] just as much & perhaps more for it makes me feel that I alone, of all of them, really know you – and if you will remember when you loved for the first time, you will remember that feeling of separateness from the rest of the world was so wonderful – Yet, why are we not together</p>
<p>if only for one day a week or one week a month or one month a year! And of course you wake up often & find me there for I am really there often & often – I wonder how it would really feel to go to sleep in your arms & wake in your arms! – to see [ˆtogetherˆ] wonderful & beautiful things that we both love, you understandingly, I blindly – to go through Rome & Venice & Siena & Assisi with my hand in yours – to see & wonder & admire all day & then to love blindly all night!
