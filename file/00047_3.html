<p>you ever think how wonderful, how transcending it would be – To think that you were in my life for so short a time & are yet there for <u>all</u> time. I sometimes wonder <u>how</u> I was able to keep from you <u>all</u> that I had to give you & to refuse to myself <u>all</u> that you might have given me – was I wise or foolish I wonder – we were together so pitifully short a time I fear neither of us can know</p>
<p>[p. 6]</p>
<p>and yet, I am so sure that <u>you</u> will be <u>the</u> one to teach me all & I am glad glad <u>glad</u> that no other man has shown me the way – But I am so <u>infernally</u> human that I often wonder if I shall be able to avoid it until that too too distant day when we shall meet again – with an almost certainty of that meeting being years ahead? Ora pro me – And <u>why</u> do you only write me once a week? It is both</p>
