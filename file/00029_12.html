<p>shown by your friend’s drawing – by the way I simply must meet him – Tell him to come to N. Y. at once, I had a long letter from FitzHenry today in which he tells me of all the splendid things they are doing at the South Kensington – I remember the last day I spent there – literally the whole day – lunch – tea – & dinner – it was a great day for me – I was alone with fine charming men all over 60 & two over 70 – ! –</p>
