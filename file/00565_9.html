<p>sheer (glorious & inspired) <u>writing</u> , I still prefer my St. Francis (Sassetta) and the Three Essays – best of all – my St. Francis that is a loving & lyric as well as learned –</p>
<p>Now I must up and “wash for low neck” to go to the Ned Robinsons – I understand Valentiner is to be there – so I dare say, I shall learn some gossip.</p>
<p>I have spent weary days and nights trotting around</p>
