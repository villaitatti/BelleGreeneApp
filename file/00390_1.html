<p>Dearest B. B –</p>
<p>That <u>surely</u> was one horrid letter you sent me – as to the “affairs” which you scent from afar it is purely a myth of your own creation. I have been <u>very</u> busy – very tired out and nervously exhausted and moving to two houses, the country house (a camp</p>
<p>[p. 2]</p>
<p>in Coney Island!) and my new little handful of a town house – the latter I go in on the 1st of October but as any present apartments are to be rented in July I had to clean them out and send my things to storage. You know very well that I have periods when I simply cannot write anyone and as writing is not a profession with me as it is with you, it does not come so easily – Besides</p>
