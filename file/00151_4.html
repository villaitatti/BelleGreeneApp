<p>day at least I looked at them both; and I used to think about her letter & really marvel at the peace & gentleness of it – It never occurred to me that she <u>could</u> die – it did not seem possible and your letter came as a real shock. I wish you could persuade Mary to come to America. Alone if you don’t want to come</p>
<p>Every body loves her here</p>
<p>and we would take <u>such</u> good care of her. I don’t believe she likes America very much, but a trip here might divert her. I feel so <u>helpless</u> about her – if there were only something I could <u>do</u> or <u>say</u> – but you know an “outsider” has no real place in such a time – But give her my love & try to make her believe in it & in me –</p>
