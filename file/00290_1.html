<p>Monday morning 9 a.m.</p>
<p>Dearest B.B. â€“</p>
<p>I wrote you at such length yesterday that I have no scandal, gossip or news left for this morning. However, I know how delightful it is to have a letter from you awaiting me the first thing in the morning and I write this in <u>case</u> you may have a similar feeling. It is <u>the</u>  <u>most</u>  <u>gorgeous</u> day</p>
