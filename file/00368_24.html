<p> <u>P.S.</u> In connection with the lot Freer has received from China which I wrote you was mightily “mysterious” – I forgot to tell you the point of the whole thing which is that he cannot get the man who sent them to name a price – The man simply says “keep them for a year and see how you like them after that we will talk terms” –</p>
