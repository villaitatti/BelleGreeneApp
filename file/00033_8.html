<p>will succeed to the Directorate of the Museum this year – but in a letter I had from him today he speaks rather despairingly of it – It is his great ambition and he is quite frankly interested in his chances – He wrote me a most amusing account of the Victoria & Albert opening and was quite brilliant about Fitz & one or two others – but through it all is a very distinct strain of dissatisfaction & restlessness which worries me. I hope you will like him although I do not quite see how you can be friends – you are both immersed in self and what the world calls “conceit” – a foolish word to cover the length depth & thickness of the article –</p>
