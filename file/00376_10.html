<p>for a year or two to come (except 2 months in Europe) until I get this whole thing wound up –</p>
<p>Duveen has a <u>very</u> fine Velasquez portrait of a man – Have you seen it? He has sent it to Boston – I presume for Wusabella to look at – Knoedler is going to have an exhibition of El Greco and Goya – They have also what to <u>me</u> , is a <u>fine</u> Bellini – To be sure <u>I</u> should never in the world know it was a Bellini, but perhaps you know the picture – It is a rocky landscape square, with St. Francis, kneeling in the right hand corner receiving the stigmata. I think they bought it in London but am not sure – By the way, I’m tickled to find that Knoedler seem [sic] to think it was <u>Duveen</u> who threw Murray out – It suits my purposes of revenge on Murray much better than they should think so – It does Murray <u>far</u> more harm – Did you</p>
