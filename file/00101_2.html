<p>always frankly announced that I liked you <u>very</u> much and since I had seen more of you had become quite devoted to you – I have <u>never</u> hesitated to say this when the subject came up – If any one I know ever says any thing of like kind just please refer them to <u>me</u> & I will enlighten [^them^] as to <u>my</u> feelings in the matter. In a way it makes me love you even more but it makes me so cross that I can’t enjoy the sensation of loving you! –</p>

<p>I have so many things to say to you I don’t know where to begin – but the most important is to tell you how <u>thoroughly</u> I enjoy your letters. They have been quite delightful and I am so much interested in all the people you are seeing and things you are doing and you are such a great <u>dear</u> to write me at such length. <u>Secondly</u>, I am quite worried about your health. <u>if</u> you really are as ill as your letters seem</p>
