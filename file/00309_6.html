<p>Sunday noon – </p>
<p>Dear B.B – I’m a lazy duffer and have just breakfasted – Had a horrid dream last night that my wonderful jade had in some unaccountable way fallen out of the window and lay in a thousand pieces in the street – <u>What</u> would the “dream book” say about that? </p>
<p>I saw Worch’ statue yesterday It is a huge stone Kwan-yin, & <u>very</u> good – It resembles somewhat one that I saw illustrated some time ago in the Burlington as belonging I <u>think</u> to Rosenberg. I wonder if the one I particularly love is the one you bought –</p>
<p>Speaking of the Burlington did you see Roger Fry’s article on the Botticelli bought by Kahn from Duveen? Rather what I thought also did you see the reproduction in the same number (April 1914) of the two Chinese Sculptures that Vignier has & which they intimated were swiped from Song-Chen? I will hunt up the number of the Burlington that has the Rosenberg things & give it to you to see if one is yours – </p>
