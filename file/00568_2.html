<p>Another question, why do you discard our Macrino d'Alba portrait [ <i>handwritten:</i> ^with^] its inscription, apparently authenticating it? – and – oh! wretched Great Man, why are my own <u>divine</u> little paintings which in your princely fashion you gave me – related to Limbo (withthe Exception of the Daddi and the little announcing Angel, which I am glad to learn is Spinello Aretino in person!)</p>
<p>All the above aside, I do greatly congratulate you upon the extraordinary achievement of this book. The mere ‘mechanics’ of it alone – aside from the stupendous larnin’ it evinces is simply staggering. I could indeed wish that it had been possible to print it on slightly heavier paper and with further ‘remarks’ from you.</p>
<p>I am so glad of the nice things you said of Constable. I liked him – both of them – so much when they were here. <u>And</u> I loved the BB’s (dos à dos) on the paper cover, and it was ‘swate’ of you to mention my 'rummy' self in your acknowledgements.</p>
<p>I dare say that you have long since seen and digested Lionello Venturi’s book. The damnedest lot of rot I have ever read. [ <i>handwritten</i> : I had a letter from him yesterday asking to come here in reference to his <u>second</u> edition – <u>Gossip</u> , and gossip only, hath it that Duveen is the producer – Personally I doubt that.</p>
<p>I have <u>millions</u> more words and thoughts to send you, but if I do not get this in the mail <u>at once</u> it willlosethe mail</p>
<p>Heaps of love and ever-abiding devotion to you, dear B.B.</p>
