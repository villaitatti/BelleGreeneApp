<p>in love with the “Lady Abbess” and the Prioress – They were Simply divine to me every time. The Prioress I loved most. She is at least 80, bent almost double but with one of the most angelic faces I have ever seen, and quicker on her feet than myself.</p>
<p>She had been in America and in “my” Library and said she saw me – I rather doubted that until, the second time I went, she</p>
<p>told me she always remembered the dress I wore – and she described it <u>perfectly</u> </p>
<p>It was one of my favourites that Molyneux designed.</p>
<p>When, on leaving, my last day, I took them some sweets – and chickens! because I learned they could only afford meat once in 2 weeks – I asked her what she would like me to send her from New York – and she said <u>Tea</u> ! They could not afford it, but from her years in England, she loved it and missed it. I <u>do</u> wish you could meet them</p>
