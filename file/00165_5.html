<p>this one – it has been a horrible nightmare – and I am glad it is almost over – I do not suppose I shall be able to sail before the end of September – perhaps about the 23d – if as early as that – What do you think will be the best place for me to join you? Shall I land in Paris or Southampton of course you will write me all these details. I hope Mary</p>

<p>does not object to my joining you – I am <u>so</u> anxious to see her – I do not think there will be any question in your mind about our meeting because we <u>have</u> loved when I see you – I think you will find all you want to in me – You are <u>rarely</u> absent from my thoughts and you are one of the few <u>real</u> things in my life – I love you dear, as I learned to last year and much more from what I have learned since I have been separated from you – I kiss you beloved fiamma mia Belle</p>
