<p>Dearest B.B. –</p>
<p>It is <u>such</u> fun to have your letters especially those from I Tatti because they, somehow, seem to contain more of <u>you</u> than do your letters from anywhere else – I am interested to hear that you will write again for Art in America – it will doubtless save the life of that magazine as they are terribly hard put to it, with Valentiner & Bode out of the running – of course we will be <u>delighted</u> to have you write up anything here – Do you want any photographs? In any case, I will send you in about a week a photograph of the ?Saturnino Gatti? Loreto House panel and I’d be tremendously pleased if you would have something to say about this. Unfortunately we must have it transferred</p>
