<p>very precious Belovedest – I love & worship you more every day – do you feel it? By the way, I received yesterday from Bain, Grünwedels books on Buddhist Art in India – I shall have great joy in reading it, as soon as these men go. Everybody knows I adore you and I'm glad and proud of it – oh! B.B. dear – <u>do</u> you remember that night of my <u>awful</u> cold. And then – sweets – !!!</p>

<p>Wednesday, May 20th.</p>
<p>Dearest – This has been a long tiresome and irritating day of interruptions – I am going home now to have a little nap as Thursty is giving a dinner for Read & Murray & I must go although I am so tired – so goodbye dear for today</p>
<p> <u>Thursday 5 p.m.</u> </p>
<p>This morning, you Beloved, I went to Worch to see his pottery Lo Han which had just arrived.</p>
