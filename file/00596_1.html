<p>Sig. Bernard Berenson</p>
<p>I Tatti, Settignano</p>
<p>Florence, Italy</p>
<p>Dear B.B.:</p>
<p>Woe is me! I just find that a letter I had written, on <u>April 10th, [handwritten: !]</u> never got off to you.</p>
<p>It said, again, <u>heap-many-thanks</u> for the magnificent Sassetta volume. As you know, I always loved the text, in fact it was my favorite of your works; but to receive this unusually finely illustrated edition and printed edition, made a perfect day – and days – for me. I hugged that copy to myself and bought one from Weyhe for the Library. I have written to a number of people to be sure to get it.</p>
<p>I am anxious to know what you are working on now, as you say you are doing “a little writing.” Things are buzzing here, but nothing of sufficient moment to write about, with the exception of the Early Christian and Byzantine Exhibition at the Walters Art Gallery. That is really worth while, even though some of the first rate things from Dumbarton Oaks were not included, because being so near Baltimore people attending the Princeton conference were just moved on to Washington from Baltimore.</p>
<p>We have had a great many visitors from Europe, due to the Princeton “affair.” I think that most of all I liked Cardinal Tisserant (who has been one of my pets for many, many years) and Grabar, although of course all of the others were most interesting also. I have not run across anyone who has seen you recently. Jack Thacher, of whom I am very fond, tells me that he will call upon you while in Europe this summer and I have entrusted many <u>loving</u> messages for you, to him.</p>
<p>I am, secretly, writing a story of the two J.P.M.’s. Let me know if you have any interesting reminiscences to add, although as I remember you two did not get along so awfully well, due to the catty jealousy of Seligmann, who did not like me either because I killed one or two of his deals and because of my known friendship with you.</p>
