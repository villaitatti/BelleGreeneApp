<p>above all to make sure you are a <u>real</u> person, not a “chef d’oeuvre” of my imagination – and to see if this love of ours can stand the test of flesh & blood contact. Do not write me here <u>after</u> August 1 – as I fear to miss your letter</p>
<p>[p. 10]</p>
<p>and after I leave all my mail will be opened – by my orders – If you can reply to this before then I shall be overjoyed – The first & main thing I want to know is – can we meet in London in August? –</p>
<p>Beloved I kiss the paper as an earnest of all I mean to be to you – </p>
<p><u>Belle</u></p>
