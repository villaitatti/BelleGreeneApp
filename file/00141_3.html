<p>to George Blumenthal at a dinner last night (my <u>only</u> night out this week) and he told me the Museum had bought a Perugino from Langton Douglas – for, I believe a large sum. I raised my hands in holy horror at the museum having <u>any</u> dealings with Douglas – & told</p>
<p>Blumenthal what I knew and thought of him (Douglas) He seemed surprised but glad to know it – <u>I</u> think the Museum is just becoming a “Bode” rendezvous & little else – There isn’t a thing to tell you and I amdistrait& don’t feel like writing so au-revoir – I love you just as much as Ever & more & I <u>want</u> to be with you –</p>
<p>Ever <u>your</u>  <u>Belle</u> .</p>
