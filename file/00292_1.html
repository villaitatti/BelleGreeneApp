<p>Dear B.B. –</p>
<p>My Sunday letter (which you had not received when you wrote yesterday) was not only written rather late in the evening but was sent fache-restants as you say, i.e. it was given to one of sister’s lovers to mail and I learned <s>that</s> next morning that he did not leave the house until day-break!</p>
