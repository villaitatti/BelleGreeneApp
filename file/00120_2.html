<p>I was numb and cold and <u>heart sick</u> and oh! so weary so weary – but not at all physically – Every moment, every place was so poignantly near to me – and my dear oh! my dear – to think you should have remembered all the <u>little</u> things I felt – were two human beings ever before in such <u>complete</u> communion? I doubt it – Daarrling <u>almost</u> would you laugh could you</p>

<p>See me at this moment after writing that last line, I simply went off into dreaming again – and awoke just now to find my <u>pen</u> in my mouth! – Heaven knows how long I have been in this imbecilic state</p>
<p>Daarrling the memory of it is almost <u>too</u> great – Thank God for that afternoon in Sarcello when</p>
