<p>B. B. you [ <i>double underlined:</i> Adorable] Person –</p>
<p>I am “tickled to death” this morning to recieve your letter of May 31 – June 2 – It makes you seem <u>so</u> much nearer to have you say you are going to Paris! I am so glad, <u>both</u> for your sake & mine – for you will have such a splendid & worth while time and will have so much to tell me of – and</p>
<p>then too your letters will reach me so much more quickly! What a meany you are not to tell me what Blyson Burreaughs said about Read – of course he would think him a horrid old <u>dud</u> etc. etc. and I should <u>love</u> to have heard his opinion. I’m glad he has no use for Murray – the low down next – I certainly would like to efface him from the map of existence and the thing that makes me <u>so</u> </p>
