I liked them too but nothing else in the house interested me much – But Winthrop himself I think is a dear, charming creature, very kindly and very modest and retiring. He spoke enthusiastically of you and I said <u>Amen</u> (literally) at which they all laughed – last night I dined with the editor of the N.Y. Times who had the Whitman's and Whitehouses and enjoyed the evening very <u>much</u> – Today I am lunching with Read & Raphael – I am to meet them at the Museum at 11:30 and Raphael is to conduct me through the Bishop Jade collection, which he says contains <u>9</u> fine pieces – then Read is going over the enamels with me – more tomorrow Belle.</p>
