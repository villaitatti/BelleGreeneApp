<p>youa very good physician? It seems almost incredible that you should be so low from no cause whatever – of course Love, although I do not speak of it often, you <u>must</u> know that I am <u>dreadfully</u> distressed about your health & your low spirits & your “ <u>retreating</u> ” ideas I don’t <u>want</u> you to be a Trappist, I don’t <u>want</u> you to go to bed when your wife is giving dinner parties & to shut yourself up in your room where people come to see you – Daarrling dear, <u>please</u> don’t do it – please daarrling <u>try</u> to be interested in all the life of your house and when Mary has parties do help her out by being your best & you know how proud we all are of you when you are at your best before our friends.</p>
