<p>I am going to Lenox tomorrow for the week-end –</p>
<p>Hear Mrs. Gardner (Wasabella) is <u>very</u> ill – I don’t wish her any bad luck, but – !!!</p>
<p>Goodnight darling. I am <u>so</u> hungry for you – Do you love me <u>very</u> much? As much as I do you? I’m afraid not –</p>
<p>Every your <u>Belle</u></p>
