<p>I should like above all things to motor through France, if you could arrange to come with me –</p>
<p>I see by your letter (of 29) you are still worrying about scandal in case we go off together. Do wake up darling, reserve your sense of humour & proportion – and realize that we – as a combination – are of no longer interest to the world – we are both to [sic] old – & both so obviously interested in such multitudes of people – and unless someone wants to frightfully flatter either one of us – no one is going to give as a thought or a word –</p>
<p>of course its [sic] rather boring to be of such little interest, temperamentally, but its [sic] useful just the same – as for me – most</p>
