<p>Dear “if you” were only here I could make you know what I want you to be to me but somehow I <u>can’t</u> write it all – I think I could stand a <u>long</u> absence – not feeling your touch or hearing your dear unamerican voice – but there is one thing that could build a wall to the other world between us – I pray it will never come to pass – I wonder if you understand you dear wise-stupid man? You call me a child but you see</p>

<p>thatproves that my love for you has made a woman of me “overnight” – I wish – but then one <u>can’t</u> wish away mountains and of course one has no moral right – but I wish I could feel that <u>I</u> was all in all to you and that no one else could claim you. You see dear I am only a very jealous very unhappy very <u>lonely</u> girl and I am by no means sure that I am all to you that I <s>can</s> ^would^ be.</p>
