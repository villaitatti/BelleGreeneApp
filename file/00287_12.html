<p>you are being so well entertained in Washington. I should imagine that it would be the most nearly European atmosphere in America. I shall write you tomorrow to Bryn Mawr and shall try to do so early enough for it to reach you Saturday night</p>
<p>I am lunching with Mrs. Charlie Knoblauch, a Bryn Mawrite [sic] on Monday at the Bryn Mawr Club, so that I shall feel quite near to you all that time.</p>
