<p>Dear B.B.,</p>
<p>This is just a hurried, and I hope you will note, immediate response to your letter of November 18th, to say that to my great regret, we do not have a gift copy of the Blake <u>Book</u>  <u>of</u>  <u>Job</u> publication at our disposal. Each member of the Syndicate who underwrote the book, received a complimentary copy, but the expense of publication was so terrific (about three times the price at which the book is being sold,) that the members of the Syndicate decided that there could be no presentation copies. Strange, and to me rather shabby, as it must appear, even Mr. Morgan has not been given a copy.</p>
<p>Of course, we will purchase a copy of your Florentine Drawings which no institution of art could do without. How large an edition do you plan to publish?</p>
<p>Very many thanks for the second copy of your <u>Raffaello</u>  <u>da</u>  <u>Montelupo</u> .</p>
<p>I have not yet heard from your friend, Alberto Moravia, who sounds most thrilling. As a mater [sic] of fact, and for some unknown reason, none of the fascinating gentlemen you write me about ever come to see me, and as neither you nor Nikki give me their New York addresses, I have no way of getting in touch with them.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for the birthday congratulations, but I have long since learned to forget that date.</p>
<p>Always devotedly yours,</p>
<p>[ <i>Signed</i> : <u>B.G.</u> ]</p>
<p>Mr. Bernard Berenson,</p>
<p>I Tatti,</p>
<p>Settignano, Florence,</p>
