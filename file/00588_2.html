<p>New Yorker or for Esquire. Never have I experienced such bald (or is it <u>naïve</u> ?) racketeering.</p>
<p>One of the most “enchanting” experiences I had, was to be taken to the <u>tiniest</u> church I have ever seen in a tiny place (about 150 inhabitants!) [ <i>inserted underneath</i> : { <u>if</u> that many] called Pürgg. Way up on a smallish mountain on our way back from Admont where I went to look at the Bible MS. which had been offered to us from time to time. It is a gaudy rough huge thing in 3 vols – but interested me because <s>clums</s> provincial – clumsily and in heavy earth colours reminiscent of the Salzburg School.</p>
<p>But to get back to Pürgg – As I said this tiny church is way up – all by itself – and so far off a naviga <s>t</s> ble road that after we left the motor car we climbed for half an hour –</p>
<p>The walls are <u>completely</u> covered with frescoes (most of which have been restored) of the 12th century.</p>
