<p>asked me about you – I once told her you admired her husband & she has never forgotten it – I have had the great good fortune to avoid meeting the gentleman (?) to date – Tommy Ryan came in to say goodbye to me today as he is sailing on the Mauretania Wednesday – He has some very fine things in his house – perhaps too late to interest <u>you</u> , Mino</p>
<p>da Fiesole, Rossellino, Francesco da Laurana – late Limoges etc. but I am very fond of him & if you run across him you must be nice to him – tell him I know you & [triple underlined: adore] you. The French government is anxious to buy a bronze bust of him by Rodin for the Luxembourg as a representation of “American force &c” – Ye Gods!!</p>
<p>I am running around the country a great deal & meeting some most enchanting people</p>

<p>and to all external appearances having a very wonderful time – but within is a very triste person who wants you very much – who wants to be loved & even swallowed up by you – I have been writing the above while waiting for the motor to take me to dinner & the theatre & now it has come & I must jump – So no more for tonight I will finish this tomorrow in time for the Mauretania</p>
<p>Oh! you dear – how we should <u>live</u> , really live, if we were together!</p>
<p>Belle</p>
