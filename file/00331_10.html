<p>to have your first letter from Paris – and even although you will be so busy, you <u>will</u> write in detail won't you dear – Neither scandal nor gossip here – I am going to begin on Monday on my Chinese reading – All my dear love to you – I wish I were with you and could kiss your 
“forget-me-not” eyes & give you a warm strangling hug – I do love you <u>so</u> much. Ever your <u>own</u> Belle</p>
