<p>There are several things I want to do this time – a motor trip through France – a two or three weeks <u>cure</u> at Baden Baden where I hear there is a wonderful Dr. Martin – a fortnight in Venice purely for fun</p>
<p>and a month either in Italy or Spain – How do <u>any</u> of these things meet with your convenience? – It may be wiser for me to take my mother with me this trip – a great bore in one way, but a great protection in another –</p>
