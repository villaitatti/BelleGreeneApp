<p>(Here I must interrupt to tell you a piece of gossip – but really <u>truth</u> , told me by a man in the Intelligence Dept – to the effect that they have enough evidence of Sireu's pro-German activities in this country, to put him in jail for an hundred years – I imagine this is why he so suddenly departed our shores [illegible deletion] You might ask Mather about it because I hear that some of the Princeton men were put on his trail also) –</p>
<p>As far as <u>you</u> are concerned with de Ricci If he is not definitely and unselfishly devoted to you and your interests, it is because, he does not have that relation to <u>anybody</u> but himself –</p>
<p>On the other hand I have never heard him say anything mean or uncomplimentary about you (and I have repeated to me pretty nearly everything he says) except in the matter of your relations with Duveen. He talks about the "Ethics" and all that stuff of the case, but I have told him, as I tell everyone else who mentions the subject that I see no difference in paying an art</p>
