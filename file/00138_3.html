<p>shall see to it that I am not beset by bores so it looks as though I would see no one – Woe is me – I <u>only</u> promised to keep it up <s>until</s> for a month, so if I am not lots better by the middle of April, I shall just throw off his fetters & kick up my heels again.</p>

<p>I must tell you that I have a <u>new</u> monogram – and if you ever have anything to send me you must put <u>this</u> one on as I use it now on <u>every thing</u> It is [<i>crossed out drawing</i>] [<i>drawing of “BB” monogram</i>]</p>
<p><u>What</u> a rotten artist – But isn’t it a darling? and the <u>joke</u> of it is that someone else designed it – <u>never</u> thinking of you – It was put, in small diamonds on a gold cigarette</p>
