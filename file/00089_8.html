<p>creature – of course many gentlemen’s fortunes have gone into her tiny hands, but the one that made us all give her a wide berth was Yerkes – that really was <u>too</u> much – I met her at Jack Morgan’s one night when the Huntington’s were there&she remembered me from that one encounter. Her affection for me seemed so intense tonight that I decided she had wearied of men and was turning her attention to “Topic no 2” – But not for little Belle! – It is so late now – I have just come in from a long dinner where I met that <u>most</u> interesting man Asquith – I must tell you all about it later for he is by all odds the most amusing person I have <s>just</s> [ˆyetˆ] met – His wife was not there&Lady Algy told me she was <u>not</u> received – I will keep this open until morning&see if there is a letter from you then – which I can answer at the same time – I do [double underlined: hope] there will be – I should be frightfully disappointed if there is not</p>
