<p>to sell me the marble bust of himself which the Kaiser presented to Mrs. Morgan for two cents – there is no question of <u>his</u> sympathies, but I am surprised to find a few people who are beginning to look carefully into the German side – That Germany <u>could</u> have a side was unthinkable a few weeks ago – I lunched with Kennerley who is about to publish a book on the war!!</p>
<p>I was dumbfounded until he told me that it would consist of the editorials, printed in the N.Y. Sun from a week before the war, until the present time – they have been <u>excellent</u> , so I think the book will be quite worthwhile. I will send you a copy as soon as it is out –</p>
