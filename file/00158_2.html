<p>Olympic & reach London July 4 – they will be at the Carlton –</p>
<p>How queer to think of you at Claridges there is little or no hope of my coming over before October – Junius Morgan is only helping us about the <u>woodcuts</u> in the Huth collection – not the books.</p>
<p>I love you daarrling and would give a great deal to be able to put my arms around your neck at this moment –</p>
<p>Ever yours,</p>
<p>Belle</p>
