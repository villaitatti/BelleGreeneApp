<p>tell you it takes all my physical and mental strength to keep J. P. cheered up and optimistic. I am with him every minute, when he is not in meetings and stay here with him often until Eight o’clock and occasionally come back after dinner – Either to talk – play solitaire with him – read to him – or just sit quietly on a little stool at his knee while he sits & thinks & shakes his great head in anger – He has “opened up” to me this year, more than he ever</p>
