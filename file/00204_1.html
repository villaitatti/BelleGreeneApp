<p>Dear B. B. –</p>
<p>I am literally <u>snatching</u> a moment in which to get a note off to you by the Olympic tomorrow – I am a wreck! – since J. P.’s return – he has really pestered the life of [sic] out of me – <u>much</u> as I</p>
<p>[p. 2]</p>
<p>adore him and won’t let me out of his sight for a moment – Not a bite of luncheon have I eaten these days – Just simply can’t get away – Fortunately he is going out of town tomorrow to spend Sunday so I can go away too and try to rest up –</p>
<p>I have not <u>dared</u> </p>
