<p>April <u>20 –</u> 1915</p>
<p>Dearest B.B. –</p>
<p>When your letter came telling of <u>your</u> illness I was sitting up in my library room at home for the first time in ten days after a devastating attack of grippe – I was <u>so</u> miserable if you have ever had the beastly disease that I could do nothing but lie</p>
<p>[p. 2]</p>
<p>in bed and groan – I am, at this moment, as weak as a kitten, but I am sure the enforced rest will have good results later on – I was taken ill two days after I came back from Boston and that is why I have not been able to do anything about the photographs of Loo’s two paintings of which I wrote you – I am however going to the Library this afternoon</p>
