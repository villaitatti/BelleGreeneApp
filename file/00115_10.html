<p>Don’t think I’m deceitful, for I’m really planning more for you than for myself although you may be inclined not to believe it –</p>
<p>I’m tired to death – went to a dinner, the opera & a party afterwards last night, got home at 2:30 & rose at 7 so as to have a French lesson at eight – have been wildly busy <u>all</u> day – am due at a dinner</p>
<p>in half an hour, the Philharmonic afterwards & a reception at Mrs. Jaccaci’s later – Did you read that La Farge had left [ <i>triple underlined</i> : every thing] in Miss Barnes hands? – The red headed hussy!</p>
<p>Ethel Grant and I cooked up a <u>wonderful</u> scheme for Ethel Harrison’s entertainment. We have engaged two of our choicest male love makers</p>
