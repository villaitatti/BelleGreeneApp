<p>what you thought of himself (Altman) & his things. I told him I had intended to come with you but that his illness prevented. We had a very hard time getting away – He always insists upon presenting me with a souvenir of some – kind worth all sorts of his tainted money – and has never been able to understand why I can’t accept it – This time I told him that I would never come again if he repeated the trick & he promised to behave – It always amuses me to find how much snubbing he will smile under – the burden of his race I suppose</p>
