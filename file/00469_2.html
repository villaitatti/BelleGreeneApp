<p>friends or mere acquaintances</p>
<p>Now for heaven's sake don't read anything horrid between the lines of <u>this</u> –</p>
<p>It is <u>divine</u> here – The peace and quiet – the glorious mountains, which stretch before & above me as I write, the dainty appointments and perfection of service to the minutest detail – and above all the cold <u>spring</u> [illegible deletion] alluring air (with snow still on the mountains) all fill me with an utter contentment and make me blissfully happy</p>
<p>You should have spent some days here before sailing – And above <u>all</u> without host norhostess!!</p>
<p>God is good</p>
<p>Belle</p>
