<p>Freer had bought it for about $8,000 – I was in a <u>rage</u> I can promise you & immediately taxed Freer with it – He got awfully mad at first, to think I would <u>dare</u> call him to account – but the next day he invited me to lunch when he explained at great length that as he had <u>created</u> Chinese Art – that of <u>course</u> he must be given things at half the price others must pay – He was most specious but did not convince me in the slightest – the whole transaction was <u>too</u> brazen – and I frankly told him so –</p>
<p>of course I intended to talk all this over with you – <u>Personally</u> I have publicly announced that I am <u>out</u> of the Chinese market </p>
