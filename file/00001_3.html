<p>with you then – I should like to feel that before you went away we were at least started on the road to friendship – This is a very frank letter but I think you understand me well enough to understand it. Why don’t you come & have tea with me some day? – Also just when are your daughters coming. I want to be sure to keep some time open to see them –</p>
<p>Sincerely yours,</p>
