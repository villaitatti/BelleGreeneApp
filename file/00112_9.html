<p>may also be my last! I love you so much daarrling and it will mean <u>so</u> much to us all our lives if you will let it – no<s>t</s> matter how we may be separated by horrid seas (you see I was instinctively right about hating the ocean) we shall always be wrapped together, be <u>one</u> in our love – I am <u>so</u> proud of having you</p>
<p>[p. 14]</p>
<p>love me dear heart, <u>so</u> proud & so grateful – I hope you may never love me less – I only hope that your life will be happier for loving me – more full of joy & the radiance of love – <u>not</u> hermit-like (I <u>hate</u> hermits, they are <u>musty</u>!) but I want my love for you and yours for me to so irradiate you that every one who comes in contact</p>
