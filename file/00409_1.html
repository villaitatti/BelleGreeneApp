<p>Sept. <u>27 – 1916</u> </p>
<p>Dearest B. B. –</p>
<p>It is so curious that I have not heard from you since your horribly disappointing cable but perhaps you think a bit of my own treatment will do me good – I am so rushed now that I cannot write you a <u>real</u> letter – this is only to tell you two things –</p>
<p>First – rumoursmay</p>
<p>come to you from one of your – or my – officious friends that I am about to be married – the rumour was started by that beastly sheet Town Topics – & was immediately taken up by all the newspapers in great headlines on the front page – with a lot of <u>fake</u> interviews with my mother & sister. I denied it at once & enclose a clipping to prove it – I was so afraid you would jump at the conclusion that <u>that</u> was why I had not written – now</p>
