<p>Later – 6 p.m.</p>
<p>Well dear lamb I was interrupted in this & have just gotten back to it & as I have my dinner party at 7 I can’t write any more – I’m afraid I write you very scrappy uninteresting letters nowadays but it’s either that or none at all – and I <u>do</u> </p>
<p>want to write you regularly if only a word – All my love to you</p>
<p> <u>Belle</u> </p>
