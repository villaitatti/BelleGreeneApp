<p>Dear Miss Greene,</p>
<p>From what I hear from others you will not be able to carry out your wish to come to Europe this fall & I regret that I will not see you before my return to New York about November 16th.</p>
<p>Our trip to Italy was a great success & we enjoyed Perugia & its surroundings even more than last time & were also much pleased with our stay at Florence. BB. was absent but we paid a visit to his house which, however, was in such disorder</p>
<p>[p. 3]</p>
<p>that it was almost impossible to see anything. Perkins (the rich part of the family) has a lovely place at Lastra a Signa, about 50 minutes from Florence & he seems veryprosperous. His next door neighbor is Caruso.</p>
<p>I suppose you heard about the trouble in the Seligmann firm. The separation of the 2 brothers is now a fait accompli & I am glad it is settled. My sympathies are of course entirely with Jacques & of course he will be the oneto stick to if onewants really good things. He will probably open a store in the Ritz Hotel within a few days.</p>
<p>I understand that instead of a house you have take a very fine new apartment</p>
