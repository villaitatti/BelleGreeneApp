I spent two delicious hours this afternoon looking at some splendid Rembrandt and Dürer etchings & some of the [illegible deletion] early [mss?] – also some extraordinary drawings that I am <u>sure</u> you would have loved – They belong to a Prof. Arthur Frothingham who is the head of the art dept. here & I lunched with them & had such a <u>splendid</u> time. Dear I <u>positively</u> cannot hold my eyes open another second – If you were here I might whisper in your ear</p>
