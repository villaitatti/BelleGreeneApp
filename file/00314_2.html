<p>several <u>really</u> charming and interesting letters from Lodge but I am (nor <u>was</u> ) by <u>no</u> means blind to his narrowness, provincialism and pedantry – but enough of Boston. I have had shoals of people at the Library today, students, dealers, friends of Mr. Jack’s old friends of Mr. Morgan who stopped in to reminisce and two females from two female colleges who wanted me to “speechify” at their commencements! I know that will make you gasp & howl with laughter, but as a fact not a week goes by, but that someone asks me to speechify somewhere – as you know I hardly ever do it, but today I succumbed to the least important, one Adelphi College for Women as the subject appealed to me – it is “vocations for women” – I’m going to go there and tell all those pretty young females that the only real & worthy vocation is marriage and a dozen children – failing that (by fair means or foul) specialization in some field – but I’m going to pound in the marriage idea for all I am worth and cite myself & a few other (by name!) as examples of <s>a</s> miserable failures in life!</p>
