<p>am interested in several of the rugs however & hope we shall secure them.</p>
<p>By the way I intended to tell you in my last that I do not know Grétor at all, have never even heard of him and have not seen him, here or elsewhere – I will keep my eyes & ears open for him however –</p>
<p>Have you a catalogue of the Hudson-Fulton Dutch Exhibition? If not I shall love to send you one – I am reading Anatole France’s Jeanne d’Arc – It is <u>too</u> enchanting & you must read if you have not already done so – I spent two hours and a half with Altman yesterday of which I will write you later – Do be friendly with Seligmann if possible – he and Rey are very useful to me –</p>
