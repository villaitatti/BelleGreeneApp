<p>You cannot go <u>half</u> a mile in the streets without seeing some poor horse drop from exhaustion and I <u>hate</u> all the humans – They look so hot & unclean –</p>
<p>I have the motors of two of my friends at my disposal so I spend most of the</p>
<p>afternoons and evenings in them, trying to keep cool – but it is hard work –</p>
<p>How amusing about Mrs. Blumenthal & Reinach – I really cannot understand how a man, such as I imagine him to be can <u>stand</u> her – <u>I</u> think she is very sweet & I believe in her good faith but conversation with her, <u>especially</u> on art topics</p>
