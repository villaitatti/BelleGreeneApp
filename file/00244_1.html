<p>Dear B. B. –</p>
<p> <u>Dee</u> votedas I am to you, I am really grudging this minute I take to write you – so busy am I –</p>
<p>It’s this damned old inventory of which I believe I have written you before – but my [ <i>double underlined</i> : exceptional] haste is due to the fact that Mr Morgan <u>must</u> </p>
<p>[p. 2]</p>
<p>have my statement before he sails and he is leaving on Sept. 15 – For the past two or three weeks I have worked <u>every</u> night (Sunday’s included) until 12 or after – I eat no lunch – (findI do verywell, by the way the omitting it) and I go to sleep only to wake up in 5 minutes and find it is morning and time to rise –</p>
<p>So this time you will</p>
