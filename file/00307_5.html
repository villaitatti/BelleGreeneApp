<p>Do forgive me for writing about him at such length. It is nothing to you and not much to me – except that it makes the job so much pleasanter & easier – on the other hand, he is capable of tiring me tomorrow. I feel sure of that. No more now dearest – I am lunching at the Ritz and tonight am “eating” at Süchow’s and going to the Germantheatreafterwards. So will finish this up and[illegible] it off tomorrow –</p>
<p>I am so happy about you and wish I could be in your arms & by your side now – Belle</p>
