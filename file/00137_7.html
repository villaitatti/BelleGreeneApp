<p>There was a portrait of a man I liked <u>immensely</u> . I <u>think</u> it was by Fiorenzo di Lorenzo – but it had such beauty – such force – virility & nobility that I was fascinated by it – Have you had it long? Then there was an adoration, Borgognona (?) that was such a divine composition & a landscape that intoxicated me – It must be a joy as to color –</p>
<p>of course you <u>knew</u> how I would</p>
<p>love the Duccio triptych – especially the right wing – It is a divine thing – and I also remember the Bartolo di Fredi Majestic Virgin & Child –</p>
<p>oh! my <u>daarrling</u> , if you were only here to look at them with me – How I should love to put you beside me on the sofa. or curl up beside you while we went through them & you told me all about them in your deliciously fascinating way!</p>
