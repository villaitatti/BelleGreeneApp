<p>Dear B. B. –</p>
<p>This is a tout-à-fait“bizness” note – Mr. Rey has today formally separated from [^Jacques^] Seligmann who will have to</p>
<p>pay Rey according to his contract for one year – of course, as I have told you, I am very strong for Rey – although I am keeping quiet about it as I can do more for him</p>
