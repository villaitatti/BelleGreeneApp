<p>reproductions of Italy’s masterpieces and 1 original water-colour of Venice, looking across from the Mole to S. Giorgio Maggiore – I have tried in vain to buy it from them, it is so utterly enchanting – The only consequence has been that they drag people in to see it every day – My bedroom was obviously made for <u>nuptials</u> , and the bath is so luxurious that I spend a large part of my time in it – As a whole, the cabins are small, very low ceilings, and not at all attractive.</p>
<p>I really think that <s>all</s> most of the walls and ceilings will have to be pulled apart to correct the plumbing.</p>
<p>I have a splendid English stewardess and a steward who was formerly a valet in N.Y., but the other passengers tell me that their stewards & stewardesses are <u>appalling</u> & seemingly have only tended <u>steerage</u> passengers before this.</p>
<p>I have slept endlessly – walked endlessly and am so made-over that I am terrified – because, of course one, has to do <u>something</u> with all that health, hasn’t one? There are only 3 or 4 Pets on board & we keep most ‘sclusively together –  the boat is almost entirely filled with Italians, of, I should say, the 2 or 3d class – most of whom had to be <u>told</u> , that we did not care for their acquaintance!</p>
