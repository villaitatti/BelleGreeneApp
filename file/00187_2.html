<p>busy lately and have found very little time for frivolity. At a luncheon at the Women’s University Club today I met a friend of your sister Senda & she told me how well and happy she was – I wonder if she’d return the letter unopened if I wrote to her at this late day? I am due to write J. P. a long letter today for the steamer tomorrow so cannot write you any longer – I wish I had been there to nurse you when you were ill – I am working hard on the European idea. I am <u>so</u> anxious to go to Spain – This is a beastly little letter but it carries tons of love to you dear – I can hardly wait to see you. <u>How</u> did you like my photographs? Ever you <u>Belle</u></p>
