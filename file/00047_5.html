<p>you ever think how wonderful, how transcending it would be – To think that you were in my life for so short a time & are yet there for all time. I sometimes wonder how I was able to keep from you all that I had to give you & to refuse to myself all that you might have given me – was I wise or foolish I wonder – we were together so pitifully short a time I fear neither of us can know</p>

Ora pro me – And why do you only write me once a week? It is both</p>
