<p>[p. 5]</p>
<p>Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>I was interrupted in writing you yesterday by a stream of people – among them the Blumenthals who are most tiresomely “devoted” to me at present – due, I think to a little warning to mind their own business which I sent to them via Glaenzer – Mrs. B for some reason unknown to me but which you may fathom was much interested in Mrs. Perkins, whom she thinks knows <u>more</u> about</p>

<p>Italian arteven thanour beloved B. B. (I’d like to benear whenyou tell him this!) but as I didn’t know the lady I couldn’t dispute the fact. She was very anxious to learn all <u>I</u> knew about Mrs. P. & when she found I knew nothing proceeded to tell me all <u>she</u> knew, which I found neither enlightening or entertaining – I fear poor Uncle Henry Duveen is in a bad way – Nothing</p>
