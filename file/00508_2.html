<p>agree to be one of a group to contribute to such a fund – I asked him how much he would give and he said "about $20,000." <s>to</s> and if he "struck oil" at that time, he'd give more – Well, that would be, at the most, $1200. a year from him – but I am certain that any <u>supplementary</u> sum you needed could be raised [<i>double underlined</i>: if] it were attached to Harvard. Noone [sic] but the Carnegie or Rockefeller foundations would endow it for <u>you</u>, I fear – and you naturally could not expect it. </p>
<p>Failing the establishment of I Tatti, I still think the Fogg Museum, <u>in every way</u> the best and the most suitable resting place for the collections – I am certain that if they were properly approached they would build you a special wing – of half the building if necessary, and there, as you know, their one idea would be to add to it and maintain it, properly and creditably. </p>
<p>I cannot think of any other place where your work would be so adequately appreciated and be made so available and so widely known.</p>
<p>And I think you ought to do <u>something</u> about it all at once – I am more and more convinced that it is a mistake to leave things up in the air, when one is in the best possible</p>
