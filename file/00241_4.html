<p>person next month. Silly as it may sound, it is an <u>awful</u> blow to me – especially just as you are coming over – but I shall have to get someone else and can probablyneverfind another so discreet and so devoted to me –Ireally feel quite cross with her for preferring a Swissauntto me</p>
<p>I am leading a <u>very</u> busy daytime life and a <u>very</u> quiet nighttime life. I go up to Rye either by train ormotorevery day about 5:30 and go to bed <u>immediately</u> after dinner and in that way I really am getting a bit rested physically and hope to be in <u>grand</u> shape by the time you arrive – and I shall keep myself absolutely free except for my work so that I can be à vòtre disposition,when you arrive</p>
<p>Ever <u>Your</u> Belle</p>
