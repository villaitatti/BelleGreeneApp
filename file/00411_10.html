<p>Cabling you about the Canadian trip – I had made <u>no</u> engagements (more than a dinner or two) whatever nor did I have [<i>double underlined: </i>any] entanglements of <u>any</u> kind whatsoever & so I was really pretty much hurt at the time of your cable – </p>
<p>I have no further time for writing now but will of course write you before sailing on the St. Louis (American line) on the 14th –</p>
<p>Always & forever</p>
<p>Your Belle</p>
