<p>Tuesday Evening</p>
<p>Dear B.B. –</p>
<p>I have just wired – no <u>cabled</u> you that I cannot get away tomorrow because of the strike in Paris – I had a wire from Ethel Grant telling me to come on the 11 train and saying she would meet me at Boulogne but they say that is almost a day’s motoring and I would</p>
<p>rather put in that time in the Museums & Seeing people here – besides they tell me at the Hotel that the trains will doubtless be in running order on Thursday and as I have millions of things to do here I decided it would be wiser to wait over. If I find tomorrow night that the trains are <u>not</u> running on Thursday I will consider the project of coming partway by motor although I do not know what to do with the trunks & things</p>
