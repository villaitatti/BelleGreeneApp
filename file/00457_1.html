<p>Dear B.B. –</p>
<p>Your letters from Paris have been <u>most</u> welcome & interesting – I have not written oftener because I have been "shut away" from people with a swollen right jaw – I thought I had got rid of all that when I paid $500. – to <s>t</s> remove an unerupted wisdom tooth from my system, but it seems that either before or during the removal some limphatic (??) <s>nerve</s> [^ <u>gland</u> ^] was affected – so that now I spend my idle hours sipping asperin [sic] & pressing an ice pack to me face – It all makes me blue & irritable so that I keep doubly busy here to "divart me attention" – I wonder what caused the burst of affection in yours of the 18 from Paris, received today – I imagine nothing more than a wave of remembrance.</p>
<p>I am utterly sure that, au fond, we <u>are</u> deeply devoted to each other & it wells up as often as our horribly crowded</p>
