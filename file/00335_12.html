<p> <u>darling</u> , am I <u>really</u> to have a little bronze? [ <i>triple underlined</i> : <u>Please</u> ] tell me that it is not expensive – Your <u>remember</u> the cost of the wonderful jade – I love & adore it & take it in my hands at [ <i>double underlined</i> : <u>least</u> ] once a day, but I am still a but uneasy about the price – and I ought not to allow you to give me another thing for hundreds of years – So <u>please</u> don’t send me anything except the tiniest thing that costs nothing</p>
<p> <u>All the Same</u> – despite all these high protestations <u>when</u> will the little bronze come? I <u>so</u> hope the man sent it by the grand vitesse – did he?</p>
<p>You must ask him – How I wish I were with you in London – <u>But</u> we would surely be in Claridge’s wouldn’t we?</p>
<p> <u>If</u> I can go over next year, I will spend about a fortnight in London & all the rest in Italy & France.</p>
<p> <u>Your</u>  <u>Belle</u> </p>
