<p>I mentioned your name casually to him the other day & as he gave no “sign” asked him if he knew you – he said he had “met” you once or twice. Wasn’t that funny? I can’t really understand why you dislike him so strongly because he is so utterly odious as to be beneath contempt. He seems to know a lot of</p>
<p>my friends. I can’t understand their even knowing him – Duveen is a prince in comparison – An interesting man from the Berlin Museum came lately – Dr. Friedländer</p>
<p>I liked him very much & we got on swimmingly, He taught me a lot the few times I saw him & I sincerely regretted that he was not to spend the winter here – I am having my portrait painted & will send you a photo of it when finished – Did you ever get the one</p>
