<p>yet I love you too – you have always been true to me to my knowledge & I refuse to let you go out of my life except of your own volition – But there I am writing a fearfully gloomy letter – I presume you have all the gossip & in any case my head is too tired tonight to write more. I wonder if I will ever find a time to</p>
<p>write you when I am absolutely at leisure, perfectly rested and have a good pen? –</p>
<p>Sounds like the millennium –</p>
<p>Believe that I love you until I tell you I don’t – & write me [double underlined: Every day]! –</p>
<p> <u>Belle</u> </p>
