<p>fact that I could have sent you a copy without consulting the Big Chief & the Paintings & Manuscript Catalogues I did send in this way but it seemed different to me about the miniature catalogue which to a casual observer is not directly in your line or indispensable to you – The edition is quite limited & I do all I can to see that they are placed to the best advantage – usually where they will benefit a large number of people –</p>
