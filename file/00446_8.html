<p>What is your grudge and when did you get it? I know that you do not know them personally so of course, what ever notions you have, have been implanted in you â€“</p>
<p>Is it your friend Duveen again? or Seligmann? or "Al"?</p>
<p>Do you know the wise, mild & elderly but altogether loveable Lord Carmichael. I like him the best almost, of the new friends I have made here this time. We have a great many friends in common so that I had the curious experience on my arrival & the following few days of constantly hearing "I want you to meet Carmichael" or "Carmicheal is very anxious to meet you" & when we met, as we did [^on^] <s>the</s> [^my^] second day here, I quite fell for his peculiar wooly charm & since then I have seen a good deal of him. Sydney Cockerell adores him & told me in detail all about his life & the bad luck he had in losing his money & having to sell most of his collection, but he still has delightful (if varied!) things & I <u>do</u> like the old lamb.</p>
