<p>fearful that we are overdoing it and giving her <u>too</u> good a time & that she may want to come again – She is looking dreadfully – I am used to the game of staying out all night but she evidently is not & drags herself around looking like a sick cat – She has not brought <u>any</u> decent clothes & no jewels & so has nothing in that line to enhance her beauty –</p>
<p>And god knows she needs enhancing – I hope I shall <u>never</u> hear her name after <s>M</s> Wednesday – of course I cannot let her know the real & complete state of my feelings towards her – She would faint if she even guessed them! It’s lots of fun though – just a regular screaming farce – of course I would feel terribly ashamed of our game if I had any respect for her but she deserves it all and more</p>
