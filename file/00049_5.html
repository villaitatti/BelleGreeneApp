<p>will reach you by Christmas Day if it takes 9 days for one of your letters to reach me but you will know at least that I love you & thought of you. Thank you so much for the “Sienese painter” book which I received from Dent. I have not had a moment to glance at it but what a thrill it gives me to see your name even in print.</p>
<p>By the way, if you</p>
