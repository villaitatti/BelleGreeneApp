<p>endless number of days in which I did not write to <u>you</u> – Curious isn’t it? –</p>
<p>Today I received your letter in reply to mine concerning Read & Agoness – and in the same mail one from Read – in which he says that he is fearfully glad that I wrote him so <u>fully</u> (??) and frankly of my friendship for you and that he had already lost a great deal of his dislike for you and would now meet you and think of you very differently – It’s</p>
<p>of course, darling, <u>damned</u> patronizing of him – but I must admit that I’d <u>like</u> to have him like you for he knows & goes about with some people who are inclined to be inimical to you and I <u>would</u> like Read to show ‘em different – There is no earthly reason darling why <u>you</u> should be bothered with Read – Don’t you know that <u>I</u> realize that he isn’t in your class and that even your talk is way over his head – No indeed, I don’t want you to feel</p>
