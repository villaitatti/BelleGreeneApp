<p>Wednesday morning – 2 <s>2</s> 3d.</p>
<p>Dearest – No letter yet – because no ship! I forgot to write you last night that I learned Sirén’s ambition yesterday, which is to be the curator of paintings at the Boston Museum – I really think it would be a good thing for them, but I cannot understand why he should want so small a post, except as an opening wedge in America – They are all so strong for him there and he made such a good impression that I should think he stood a very fine chance –</p>

<p>What do you think? If I am asked (which is not at all likely) shall I boost him or not? I imagine that Wusabella is very keen about him, [ <i>double underlined</i> : but] it may be that she is just trying to tie him up to her & those are not her real feelings – Post told me too that she was strong for Sirén – <u>Later</u> – I enclose the end of a note I got from Sirén in reply to mine of last night apologizing for not waiting for him – Only a Swede could be as clumsy & <u>un</u> convincing as this – I am just leaving the Library to have tea with Gertrude Atherton so more tomorrow – I <u>do</u> love you darling and I’d give a million cents (all I have!) if you were here – B.</p>
