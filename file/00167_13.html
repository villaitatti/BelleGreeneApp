<p>wrong – Daarrling how <u>can</u> you stand him?</p>
<p>I know Mrs. Harry Markoe of whom you write. I always liked her although J. P. finds her a dreadful bore –</p>
<p>I do not know her husband, in fact never knew she had one – she is rather snubbed by the rest of the Markoe family –</p>
<p>Daarrling it is to laugh when you revile me</p>
<p>for what you are pleased to term my “flirtations” For you certainly “console” yourself with plenty of ladies – in fact no island was ever more completely surrounded by water than you are by dames – a fact which I had not really noticed until you began to scold me so for my one or two little excursions into masculine hearts – And please don’t think</p>
