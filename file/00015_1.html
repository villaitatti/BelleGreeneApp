<p>Friday – <u>April</u> 23 </p>
<p>Preferé de mon coeur –</p>
<p>I received today your letter from Cintra of the tenth. Is it not disgusting that eleven days should elapse before I have your written words? Your letters have become so necessary to my happiness – strangely necessary indeed and I fear that I am not quite reconciled as yet – I work and play frantically to forget</p>
<p>[p. 2]</p>
<p>you – without avail for you are always there – the background of my days and nights. I suppose that in the course of human nature (<u>my</u> human nature & <u>yours</u>) and if you stay away from me long enough that I will forget you and you will forget me – and that we both will go our separate ways – you the path of fame and glory – I the path of all “sordid victims” </p>
<p>You bid me close prating of my love for thee & instead tell you minutely the sordid happenings </p>
