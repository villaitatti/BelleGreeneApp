<p>cases for us and so we had a good opportunity of examining the pieces which interested us. Murray & Read joined us shortly before one o'clock and we all went up to the Plaza for luncheon where I had some slight fun making them drink two cocktails each after luncheon After luncheon Raphael Read and I, went up to the American Museum of Natural History and spent two wonderful hours there. I don't believe Read knows much of anything else but he was quite in his element with the Mexican and South American things – read the glyphs for me and explained everything. He knew the big turtle you and I admired so much as the original Maudsley cast was in the B.M. – and of course he knew all the other Maudsley things – they adored all the things you and I loved so much – the wonderful wooden beasty he told me was a <u>drum</u> altogether it was the first grand time I had had since you left.</p>
