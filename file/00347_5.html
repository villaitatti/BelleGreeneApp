<p>thinking of you or living mentally with you. I hope this does not sound <u>gushy</u> for I do not mean it or <u>feel</u> it that way – I simply live more with you, than in any other way – If you come over, you can have all of my time that you will take and I have <u>no</u> idea of encroaching upon <u>yours</u>; I want you to see all the people who like you so much and do all the things that interest you and I feel sure you will leave lots of time for me –</p>
<p>If you <u>do</u> go to Freer's I hope I can arrange a chaperone</p>
