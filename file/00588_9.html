<p>magnificently played – The Roland statue, I thought far finer – and certainly more impressive –  than the one at Halberstadt and the Rathaus – beyond <u>any</u> other I had seen – There was much more, and you doubtless know the place <u>far</u> better than I could know it in one day, but it was one of the most delightful days I had in Germany ( <u>maybe</u> ? because I was all alone?)</p>

<p>already taken 10 days and I learn that there are at least 2 more to go –</p>
<p>I have rested to a point where I doubt if I have the strength to step over a straw – With 2 exceptions (besides a bunch of Harvard kids with whom Bobbie plays around) the crowd are less-than-middle-class Germans and Americans – When any of them speak to me, I just give a stoney stare – rather an utterly vacant stare – and either march on or return to my book.

I can just see Mussolini spitting out of one corner of his mouth if he heard it – but, as I promised before I left, I just smile and don’t say a word –</p>
<p>Now I must stop – as I have lots of other letters to get off – I <u>loved</u> seeing you, and will look forward to seeing you next Summer – <u>Heaps</u> of LUV –</p>
