<p>Dear B.B.</p>
<p>I am giving a letter of introduction to you to a very brilliant young man, Marvin Chauncey Ross, who will delight you by being extremely shy. In my opinion he is, without any question <s>an</s> the outstanding scholar on enamels in this country and, I think, will soon be recognized internationally. He is only a kid, but has already made several important publications. It was my great pleasure (and [^is^] my present pride) to be able to place him on the staff of the Walters Art Gallery, where he is in charge of the mediaeval art objects. Knowing the Walters collection as well as you do, you can realize that that is some job! I am sending you by todayâ€™s post the Handbook which has just been published. This is probably copy No. 3 for you, as I put your name on the list of those to be sent out from the Gallery.</p>
<p>Marvin, like everyone else who has not had that excitement, is very anxious to meet you, and I know that you will be as kind to him as you always have been to all my friends. Please do not be put off by his youth and shyness.</p>
<p>With my best remembrances to Mary and Nicky and my undiminished love to you,</p>
<p>Devotedly yours,</p>
<p>Belle</p>
