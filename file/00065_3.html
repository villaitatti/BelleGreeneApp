<p>as if I had left all the Sun & warmth of life behind when I left you at the Beaux Arts? I have had such a <u>curious</u> experience lately of which I will surely write you in my next. I have just come from the Gould – Drexel wedding & reception. She looked <u>so</u> pretty & happy – I hope</p>
<p>she is – The crowd was not <u>especially</u> good – I will have my photograph taken when I return from Boston on the 15th of May – I am too worn out now – You would not recognize me & I weigh fully fifteen pounds less than when you saw me last –</p>
<p>“Aint – Grand?” –</p>
<p>As ever yours & only yours,</p>
<p>Belle</p>
