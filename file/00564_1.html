<p>I Tatti</p>

<p>Florence, Italy</p>
<p>Dear B.B.: â€“ </p>
<p>After months of plugging on the beastly Five Year Report of which I hope a copy has already been sent you, I am just settling down to attend the correspondence which has been neglected, and find Nicky's letter of the 5th of July asking about the Italian Bible at Holkham Hall. This Manuscript is still there and I doubt if it will be purchased by anyone except possibly by ourselves at some future time.</p>
<p>I find I have so much work to do here and am so physically exhausted that I shall not attempt to get to Europe this year, but if I can snatch any time at all, will go up into Canada for a few weeks. </p>
<p>Are you still planning to go to North Africa this coming winter? That is a trip which I should love to take with you, so when you have decided upon your plans and if I might be allowed to come along, do cable me so that I can try to arrange it. Both Marthe Hyde and a number of other people have at various times asked me to go with them, but not only was I unable to arrange the time but also I wanted to go with someone sympathetic like yourself. </p>
<p>Do give my most respectful regards to Mary, my affection to Nicky and my [<i>underlined in pen</i>: <u>purple love to yourself.</u></p>
<p>[<i>signed</i>: <u>B.G]</u></p>
