<p>My first letter in <u>1921</u> </p>
<p> <u>10 a.m.</u> </p>
<p>Dear B.B. –</p>
<p>Thanks for your New Years telegram – I am staying in (or rather <u>on</u> the) bed today in a desperate effort to <u>rest</u> this cold out of me –</p>
<p>A few – very few – choice friends are coming in to see me, but aside from that I shall simply rest.</p>
<p>The house is <u>divinely</u> </p>
