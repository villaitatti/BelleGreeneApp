<p>By the way I saw Benny Altman the other day & he said he was about to sail for London – so you may see him there. He says he is going to begin collecting Early Italian paintings & I congratulated him – I think him an impossible creature personally but I will be glad if he brings over some nice things – I believe he is going to be at the Ritz – If you happen to see him, please don’t let him know I wrote you he was coming</p>
<p>as he told me as a great secret also I’d hate to have him know I wasted all this time and paper on him – Have you see the Big Chief yet? – I hear that my beloved “Corsair” has left & will be here early in August – I’m glad because that means he will not tarry long after it – Goodnight dear – I’m sorry I have written you so long a letter because I know how you hate them – but I may not have a chance to write soon again –</p>
<p>My love to you</p>
<p>Belle.</p>
