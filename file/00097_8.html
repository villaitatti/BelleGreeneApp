<p>meet & then am to dine with Mr. Read & some friends of his and go to the theatre – Mr. Read is having a grand time, being dined & lunched & fêted to his heart’s content. I  am going to give him a dinner party at the Colony Club next Thursday and am trying to assemble all the beautiful blonds in New York for him. <u>I</u> shall probably look like a huckleberry in a bowl of milk! – the Williamsons had an [<i>triple underlined</i>: awful] time at the Customs House</p>

<p>I didn’t intend to be bothered with them & fortunately was at the other end of the dock but they took out every single thing in their trunks & shook out their clothes & questioned them minutely – It really was a disgrace for they had their passports showing they were British citizens & only here for a visit – but the <u>funniest</u> thing was that Williamson had a miniature of Milton, which he had brought over in the hope of selling it to J. P. – and he handed it to the Customs marked as being genuine of the 17 century</p>
