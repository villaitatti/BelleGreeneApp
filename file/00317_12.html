<p>Now I shall close this <u>endless</u> scrawl darling & do hope you don't hate me for the length of it – I think by the time I get through with these two men they are going to be friends and admirers of yours (not that you care of course, I know that)</p>

I love you more every day – Have you received the catalogues yet? be <u>sure</u> to let me know if <u>all</u> you wanted are there. Your Belle</p>
