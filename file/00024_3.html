<p>utterly outside the limits of experience – I still believe that somewhere there is a flower to be plucked – a lamp to be rubbed – or a form of words to be spoken which will reverse the humdrum laws of nature – call up unwilling spirits, bound to incredible services and change all this brown life of ours to scarlet and azure and mother-of-pearl –</p>
