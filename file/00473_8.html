<p>called me up and asked me to luncheon yesterday – after much preliminary conversation she leaned forward and said, "Do tell me, <u>just</u>  <u>what</u> do you think of <u>B.B</u> .?" I replied "Oh let's not talk of <u>Mr. Berenson</u> now, I still miss him too much" –</p>
<p>I bet that gave her food for thought – <u>and</u> gossip! The only clue, I will give you is that it was not a member of your "lowest form" – She will probably write you about it & then my one secret will be out –</p>
