<p> <u>Tuesday, June 17</u> </p>
<p>Dear B. B. –</p>
<p>I know that I deserve a good beating, for the past two weeks it has been physically, mentally and morally impossible for me to write a line –</p>
<p>I foolishly allowed myself to get violently overwrought and excited</p>
<p>[p. 2]</p>
<p>about what! – Housekeeping! – Did you ever hear anything <u>quite</u> so silly?</p>
<p>I awoke to the fact – very suddenly and very tardily that my house was running loose – none of the servants “functioning” and nothing fit to eat or live with, [ <i>double underlined:</i> so] I took it in hand “with a hell of a yell”</p>
