<p>Such joy that at times I am afraid <u>every one</u> can read it in my face – I have lots to tell you of Mrs. Blumenthal & Mrs. Lydig in my next – Get well & strong – [ <i>double underlined</i> : very] dear & love me as much as you can for without your love I <u>could</u> not live –</p>
<p>Did you get my New Year’s cable – Daarrling all the years to come are <u>ours ours ours</u> as I am</p>
<p> <u>Yours</u> Belle</p>
