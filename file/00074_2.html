<p>if you were to be there, I could stay two – <u>but</u> as you will not be there I shall go to Paris probably on the 24th for a week – Then I go to Genoa, Turin, Milan, Venice, etc for all of September[.] I shall probably have to go back to Paris on</p>
<p>the first of October and to London on the 10th – and will sail from there on the Adriatic leaving <u>October 19th</u>  <u>D. V.</u> – I should really like to go some place where you are to be and play with you but I simply <u>cannot</u> </p>
