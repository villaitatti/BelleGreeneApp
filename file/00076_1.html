<p>Friday, <u>July 29</u></p>
<p>Dear my love –</p>
<p>I have a most charming letter from you today dated the 16th! It must have struck a very slow steamer as I have already have [sic] had the one of the 19th – but the <u>more</u> the merrier & happier for me – I also now</p>
<p>[p. 2]</p>
<p>have your enchanting cable saying you will give up all of your time to me in London, Paris & Italy – what a <u>dear</u> you are – I didn’t really want you to do it – it seemed so unfair to you – but I love you a million times <u>more</u> for doing it – You</p>
