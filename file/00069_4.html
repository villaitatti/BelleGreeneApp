<p>Tuesday –</p>
<p>The most important event of the week is the Big Chief’s return on Wednesday – I am much excited about it as always and can hardly wait – According to reports he has bought loads of things, and I do hope that the good outnumber the bad this time. Dearest I am not going to write</p>
<p>any more as I feel <u>very</u> stupid & bromidic. I went to a party [^last night^] which lasted until 2:30 this a. m. and I haven’t a consecutive thought to my credit. I will write you very soon again. By the way Alice Ditson is at the Hotel Liverpool in Paris. <u>Do</u> call on her</p>
