<p>Florence, <u>Italy</u> .</p>
<p>Dear B.B.</p>
<p>Just a line to say that I am having photogrphs [sic] of odds and ends of the della Rovere Pontifical, taken for you to-morrow, as on the next day, we are shipping it with about half a dozen others to Paris, for the exhibition of Italian books and manuscripts, to be helf [sic] there during May and June; but I know that you have received more photographs than you have noted in your letter, because I had them especially taken for you the last time you were here. They are undoubtedly mixed up with some other photographs of your collection, but I will send you duplicates.</p>
<p>I am going to have photographs taken of the unusual (for me) rare Italian manuscripts before 1350 or 1400 hundred at the Paris Show. Do you want any of these?</p>
<p>Do you remember two Italian histrionic initials of which I sent you photographs several weeks ago, our manuscript <u>number 558 c.d.</u> One represents the Trinity in human form, and the other, The Baptism in the Jordon [sic]. You referred me to Toesca page 528 which is O.K. but just after sending it to you, I found in a photograph of some manuscript offered, a representation of Pope Gregory, giving Communtion [sic], which is <u>undoubtedly</u> by the same artist, the faces, and various characteristics correspond with our two miniatures, but the interesting thing is, that beneath the miniature is an inscription reading:
[ <i>handwritten:</i> (see <u>over</u> )]</p>
<p>perhaps you may be able to check this up in some way.</p>
<p>We are hoping to acquire five really A.l. manuscripts (before twelve hundred, [ <i>handwritten, underneath:</i> 1200]) if we succeed, I will send you photographs.</p>
<p>Ever devotedly yours,</p>
