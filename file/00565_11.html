<p>the Camb. Univ. Liby was also a dear – the others were pretty stiff-necked – </p>
<p>Hind of the Prints Dept. of the B.M. is here and he & I have much the same sort of innocently amusing times & trips as Eric Millar & I did when he was over here. Goldschmidt (of Berlin) who is one of my pets, is also over this year. We work all day when he comes to New York (he is at Harvard) and I take him to “Harlem”" and giddy shows at night. </p>
