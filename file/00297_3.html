<p> <u>You</u> that lovely jade is to me and how much it will be <u>You</u> all the time that we are separated</p>
<p>It seems rather dreadful to love an inanimate thing as much as I love that jade – but there are <u>so</u> many reasons why I adore it – In the first place it was from <u>You</u> that I first learned of the <u>existence</u> of such material, then You, quite out of the blue, promised to send me a piece – and then I saw Freer’s and loved it</p>
