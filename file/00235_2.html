<p>to nor can one expect it, so far away – I <u>wish</u> I could go to you – I seem to have come very suddenly to the parting of the ways and it is very hard for me to know which to take. I have many things to hold me here and little to call me away and yet – I want so much to get away. I have no fixed idea of what I want to do – For one thing I want to study a <u>great deal.</u> That is certain – and I want so much to travel and learn in that way – I want to be with the minds (at least or at most!) of the men I know in London and Paris – and – most of all, I want to be with you! But how to accomplish any of it – Mr. Morgan begged me so often and so repeatedly to stay in here – besides that, there is so much I have to do here – I ought to remain, for the Library’s sake, for at least two years</p>
