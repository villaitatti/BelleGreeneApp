<p>get me up to the Farm or to her house – She really bores me <u>too </u>much –</p>
<p>She telephoned me today to say she had had a Christmas letter from you which seemed to please her – I told you, did I not, that she has begun on a new baby? Eugene, according to reports from the street has lost shoals of money, but I do not know whether it is true or not – in any case they have sold their Park Avenue home (Eugene told me for $750,000. –) and are moving on January 2d to the St. Regis Hotel. I think Eugene got tired of seeing it empty and certainly don’t blame him for getting that White Elephant off his shoulders.</p>
<p>Duveen is not ready to do any business at present – He tries to keep Mr. Jack good natured by talk of next year,  but personally I don’t think that he’ll will be in any better</p>
