<p>one day nearer to you – and it is shockingly late – I don’t dare look at the clock – & I must hie me to bed – I am sending this letter to Paris although I fear you will have left there before it reaches you –</p>
<p>It is in the nature of things that you should become – sooner or later – disappointed in me – but oh [double underlined: please] do not let me be disappointed in you –</p>
<p>Belle.</p>
