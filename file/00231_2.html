<p>I went down to the Kaiser Wilhelm last Tuesday to see Mrs. Blumenthal off and was <u>sick</u> with grief and envy – I wanted to go along <u>so much.</u> There were a number of my friends on board and I ached to be withandof them – this just a line to tell you I [ <i>underlined multiple times:</i> love] you and miss your letters. I am going out in my car now to beat up the Motor Parkway – I have a race on with a90Mercedes & hope to win –</p>
<p>all my love to you daarrlingest</p>
<p> <u>Your</u> Belle</p>
