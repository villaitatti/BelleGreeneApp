<p>We had a nice longchinof half an hour and he insisted upon my lunching with him at one – which I shall do – I am sure I do not know why I like him so much but I certainly do –</p>
<p>Worch has just telephone that he has a most <u>wonderful</u> piece of sculpture which has <u>just</u> arrived and that he wants me to see it before anyone else so I am going there after luncheon and if possible will take Putnam with me – It’s one gorgeous day – simply overpowering</p>
<p>the air is like a thousand fairy kisses and the sun simply outdoing itself in glory – I am going to motor up to the Sleepy Hollow Club for tea and going out for a quick dinner at eight o’clock with Kennerly – I hope to be in bed by ten o’clock. Last night I dined with the Martin Egan’s – He is the new man in the Morgan firm and is running the “publicity” end of it. We had an intensely interesting talk until one o’clock but as it was <u>all</u> financial and political it would not interest you – Mrs.TruetonBeale of Boston, Mrs. Jack Morgan’s</p>
