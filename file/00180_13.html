<p>late 9thto the 11 century</p>
<p>There was a short article about the collection in the Sun here [ˆcopy ofˆ] which I will try to get & send to you – I sent my copy to J. P. – but I enclose a copy from the meeting of the Archaeological Institute lately when the President announced</p>
<p>them. Of course this gives you little or no idea of their contents or value – But you shall see them all when you come over (oh! blessed thought) Now as to that blessed time. I will make absolutely <u>no</u> engagements as soon as I find out <u>when</u> you are coming and how long you stay also</p>
