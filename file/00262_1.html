<p>Dear B. B –</p>
<p>I have just finished your delightfully voluminous correspondence</p>
<p>First – your Van Horne letter has decided me not to go to Montreal, although I had made plans to do so – I have a great many letters of introduction for there, among them one to a Mr. Ross, who, I understand has the best collection</p>
