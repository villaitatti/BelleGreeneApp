<p>acquaintances in common – </p>
<p>All the kings, dukes, and ‘great’ of the world, are or have been desperately in love with her, as I am – but <u>don’t</u> hold that up against her, as I am sure you are doing at this moment! And I have not a moment in which to rewrite this and omit that fatal sentence – </p>
<p>She has no knowledge of ART (not even a suspicion) – but she has incredible charm and “lovingness” – and I so hope that you both will love her as I do and that you will become real friends – She will be in Florence for a week or two late in February or early in May and I will ask her to write to you then – Much love – Belle Greene  </p>
