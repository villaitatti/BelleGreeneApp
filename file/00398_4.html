<p>that Loo has. He calls it Chan or earlier & the color is the most wonderful & divine thing I have <u>ever</u> seen – Dark, rich full greens, deep blues, an extraordinary malachite and splotches of an "earthy" red – He is asking $20,000 – for it and I'd rather own it that [sic] any bronze I have seen or hope to see – Freer is crazy about it but very sore because he thought he had bought it once in China, but they cheated him out of it & sold it to Bing – Bing is selling a great many things through Loo – the last being a Beauvais tapestry in Chinese design – I hated the thing but "sicked" a dealer friend of mine on to it who bought it for $27,500 – and sold it</p>
