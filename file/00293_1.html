<p>Dear B.B. –</p>
<p>I did not know that <u>any</u> post could be worse than the Italian but evidently Bryn Mawr excels there as in everything else. I am so relieved that you are settled for tea on Saturday afternoon – and with so harmless a person! Unless I hear from you to the contrary I shall meet you at Knoedlers at 3 p.m. <u>sharp</u>. I shall probably be there myself a few minutes earlier. To <s>be</s> [^have you^] detained in the Deanery would be against the White Slave Act and I should have the authorities proceed at once – we are filled up with a New Haven meeting here now – c’est à rire – the meeting is being held at the direction of the men, who have supposedly resigned from all control or interest. The outlook <s>too</s> appears muddy to me – as you</p>
