<p>Dear B. B. –</p>
<p>Your letter of April 13 from Hyères reached me today only – what a bore these tramp steamers are!</p>
<p>And so you have met Joseph Bédier – and you ask me for 2 pages or more <u>to be – for once</u> – <u>truthful – honest etc. etc</u> . and tell you if his name means anything to me! [ <i>double underlined</i> : Why] should I lie?</p>
<p>Well – it does. and those three words comprise and compress countless pages from me – I have loved his Tristan for more years than I can, at this moment, remember. I have bought and given away <u>at least</u> 50 copies.</p>
<p>For the last few years I have only been able to get [^here,^] a horrid edition on thick yellowish paper</p>
