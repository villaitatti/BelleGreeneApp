<p>position in January or February – They <u>seem</u> to be quite down on their luck but you never can tell withsuchas they – I think Mr. J is quite surprised that it is not as easy as he thought to get rid of the things.</p>
<p>Now I must stop – I am missing you and wanting you a great deal – a very great deal – I feel absolutely out ofjointwith every thing here and don’t much care whether “schoolkeeps” or not –</p>
<p>I envy you, being with yourself and I envy everyone who is with you – I think you would <s>fiendishly</s> sardonically and revengefully laugh at me if you knew how much I wanted you – how <u>always</u> I think of you – and how I want to kiss you – and kiss you –</p>
<p>You don’t know what it's like to really <u>need</u> anyone – You’re too busy and have too many interests –</p>
<p>I love you with my mind and body –</p>
<p>Your <u>Belle</u> </p>
