<p>to stay in <u>bed</u> all day – and see if that will not “put me up” a bit for the following week – I’m afraid this is a very gloomy letter – but I leave an <s>queer</s> habitual melancholy which “on dit”is a direct result of my malarial attack.</p>
<p>I will write you by</p>
<p>the Lusitania next Wednesday –
B. B. daarrling you have been <u>wonderfully</u> staunch and true to me & don’t think I do not realize it and love you the more for it – You will find me <u>just</u>  <u>the</u>  <u>same</u> when we meet –</p>
<p>Ever <u>your</u> Belle.</p>
