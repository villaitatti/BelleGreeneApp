<p>Most Preshus B.B. –</p>
<p>I am “way up in the air” again this morning at receiving a heavenly long letter from you detailing your life from the 7th on –</p>
<p>What an enchanting life you darling and how I should love to have been with you all of the time giving you only time for your “lady friends” to yourself.</p>
<p>[p. 2]</p>
<p>I shall be so glad to have the photographs from Rosenberg of all your things – I am tremendously interested in what you say about the “beasty” at Worch – I cannot help still being mad about it but I remember that you by no means shared my excitement over it at the time Freer offered $22,500. for it which Worch refused – He offered the group & beasty to Eugene Meyer for $105,000.00 but of course they were out of the running. From what you write me of Sambon’s catalogue</p>
