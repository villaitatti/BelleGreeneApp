<p>any length of time – after wiring you, I broke all engagements for evenings of this week & all except business ones for day time. It is <u>too</u> horrible – I had no idea there would be such difficulties when I left NY – I cannot see <u>why</u> you cannot come over, although I know now it would take you an awful time. [ <i>double underlined:</i> If] you cannot come and <u>if</u> I cannot go over with assurance of a return, I will sail for home either the 11th or 18th as there is no point in my staying here & Claridges is eating me out of house & home – <u>all</u> their prices are almost doubled – I’ll wire you tomorrow – It takes <u>days</u> to get J.P. to make up his mind when he wants me to do a certain thing which is why I <u>could</u> not wire earlier – come to N.Y. from Paris – Always your Belle</p>
