<p>30 March, 1921</p>
<p>Dear B.B. –</p>
<p>I can hardly believe that only a week has passed since you left – only the calendar convinces me –</p>
<p>Now – where did my last diaristic epistle stop? – I think at Saturday when I went out to Dan Platts.</p>
<p>It was a heavenly day – indeed the weather has been utterly intoxicating</p>
