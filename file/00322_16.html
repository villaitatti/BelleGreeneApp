<p>almost sick at the idea all afternoon – but it went off fairly well – Murray did <u>all</u> of the talking – which was all gossiping – He told me all the rascalities of everyone. I listened very attentively but made <u>no</u> comments. Among other things he told me of many phoney and crooked deals he had caught Bode in – and generally led me to believe that he was the only pure and lily white soul in the business – It made me too sick to <u>eat</u> to listen</p>
