<p>Sorry I missed sending this by the Aquitania but was so hopelessly busy it slipped my mind – Have just [<i>^</i>re-^] read the foregoing pages – They sound – the J.P. ones at least – like some of the wild letters I get from a few kid girls & boys who <u>think</u> they have a “crush” on me – A month or more ago I would have destroyed them, now I am determined, in writing you – to be free – to let you see my crazy-ill-balanced feverish or all anaemic self as it is – If – in spite of – you still want B.G. – not any B.G. of your or others’ creating but as she <u>is</u> – why all is well </p>
