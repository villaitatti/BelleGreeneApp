<p>and was not able for a moment to return to my letter –</p>
<p>About Murray – I pownded [sic] his ignorance, inefficiency, laziness and seeming dishonesty into Mr. Jack until he became utterly disgusted with him and refused even to <u>see</u> him. He scrubbed Murray <u>right</u>  <u>and left</u> and I laughed and sang <u>inside me</u> for joy at it. The first notable instance was at the first meeting with Duveen after they arrived here – I <u>may</u> have already told you all</p>
<p>about this – but for fear I did not – I’ll repeat –</p>
<p>The meeting was to take place at four o’clock at the Library – Lo and behold Duveen (both of them) arrived at 3:30 and 2 minutes later Murray hobbled in – I was pretty certain that it was a pre-arranged meeting <s>so</s> </p>
<p>The Duveens were over-effusive to me and sat by my desk talking vigorously <u>at</u> me – While Murray betook himself to Thursty’s desk & turned his back on</p>
