<p>meetings with Agoness & the Duveens & anyone else I know or know of there. Yes I think Duveen and Murray will work together very nicely for each other & to J. P’s loss – But <u>I</u> don’t intend to have any more sleepless nights over the matter. Eugene told me of the very nice letter you wrote Agoness and I was very glad of it – But oh! you farling, I am <u>really</u> cross that you did not tell me what Vignier said about <u>Read.</u> That is <u>awfully</u> mean of you, for you must know that I want to hear it – I am curious to know what somebody who is in the business thinks and hears of him – and I also want to know what Bryson Burroughs said too. If you can’t (or won’t) tell me all that, then we are not as close to each other as I thought and hoped and believed. I see by the papers that Benson bought the Titian La Schiavonetta (gosh! is that right) that I saw here at Gimpel & Wildenstein. I <u>hope</u> you put that over & not Murray –</p>
