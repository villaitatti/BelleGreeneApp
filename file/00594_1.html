<p>Dear B.B.:</p>
<p>I have been shockingly bad about writing you, and you are, as always, an angel to show your forgiveness by your letter of June 2nd just received – one month in transit!</p>
<p>To answer your queries first – The Swarzenski book is the only publication we have made in these horrible war years. I, too, think it a very good piece of work. It is a marvellous manuscript.</p>
<p>Meyer Schapiro of Columbia is working on our earlier 10th Century Beatus Ms. and if he <u>ever</u> finishes his study we hope to publish it, but he has been “at it” almost a year now. We also have several other publications in view.</p>
<p>Frankfurter of the Art News tells me that he will “be seeing you” shortly, and I have given him hectic salutes to you. As you doubtless know, he has the most interesting and worth while idea of devoting a complete issue of the Art News to the Gardiner collection and hopes that you will write an introduction. I do also, but cannot see you writing a long spiel about yourself, and of course, it is all due to you.</p>
<p>I am trying to recuperate, meaning get somewhat, if only a little bit, revitalized after a bad two or three years. I will doubtless be back “on the job” before you receive this.</p>
<p>Louis Levy has been here but I did not get to see him as the M.D. kept me abed for a week or two. I would have been interested to hear his Duveen you et al talk, as I understand from a lawyer friend of mine here, he is writing a book on that and other of his causes celébres.</p>
<p>When you have time, write me of all you are doing, whom you see, etc., etc. I understand that there are several of our “vagrants” over there and that Offner is in the offing – or perhaps he has arrived?</p>
<p>My Love to you and best regards to Nicky. How is she?</p>
<p>Devotedly,</p>
<p>[ <i>handwritten:</i> Belle (d)]</p>
