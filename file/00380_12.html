<p>splendid work Allom has done downstairs – A letter from Read says that Murray is confidently expecting to return here in May and is telling everyone so – He certainly will get the surprise of his life if he writes over <u>here</u> about it –</p>
<p>Now I must run – I am going to a dinner at Mrs. Jack Morgan’s which is to be followed by a coming out reception for her daughter Frances – I hate to go but fortunately I hear that some of the rest of the family are to be there at the dinner – they invited Thursty for the reception later, of which I am very glad – Did I tell you that Mrs. Jack wants me to visit her in England this summer if <u>any</u> of us are able to go over – Be sure that if I do <u>have</u> to go I will not stay more than a week – and if possible only a week-end – Goodbye darling – I wish you were here – why <u>don’t</u> you come over, now that Italy is surely going to war. Write and ask Wusabella <u>why</u> she is pro-German. <u>Your devoted</u> [ <i>double underlined:</i> Belle]</p>
