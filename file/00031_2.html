<p>me <u>as soon</u> as you get them. I am so distressed that these complications have arisen – I am dying to hear of your visit or visits to Princes Gate & hope to have a letter from you (sent to Mrs. Ditson) when I return to the Lib’y & my labours on Wednesday – I gather that the letters have all been returned to your Settignano (or Florence) P.O. address – I do hope it is o.k.</p>
<p>I love you so much that it really <u>distresses</u> me to have these stupid things happen and I also hate to think four letters from you never having reached me. They tell me here that the letters were sent to the Dead Letter Office in</p>
