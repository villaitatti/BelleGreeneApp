<p>me as soon as you get them. I am so distressed that these complications have arisen – I am dying to hear of your visit or visits to Princes Gate & hope to have a letter from you (sent to Mrs. Ditson) when I return to the Lib’y & my labours on Wednesday – I gather that the letters have all been returned to your Settignano (or Florence) P.O. address – I do hope it is o.k.</p>
<p>I love you so much that it really distresses me to have these stupid things happen and I also hate to think four letters from you never having reached me. They tell me here that the letters were sent to the Dead Letter Office in</p>

<p>Washington & from there I learn they were opened & returned to the address within – Therefore, I presume one went back to Paris & the others to I Tatti – I have been sailing all day & dancing all evening and am too tired (not to say sunburned & warm!) to write more. Did you go to the Reid ball? It must have been very fine – I am so overjoyed that my dear Boss is returning!! As for you I could shake you & kiss you in the same moment –</p>
<p>Devotedly</p>
<p>Belle.</p>
