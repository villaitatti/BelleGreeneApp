<p>letters to you or yours to me – The whole world may know how I feel about you as far as I am concerned – I am so proud and happy to love you – Sometimes I think it was just as well that we had that Hellish time in September for has it not made our new love, a deeper, stronger, <u>bigger</u> thing?</p>
<p>[p. 4]</p>
<p>We <u>know</u> now that <u>nothing</u> can hurt it – it is <u>apart</u> above & beyond all human efforts to hurt it and I am <u>so</u> glad – oh! <u>so</u> glad my dear dearest love –</p>
<p>I hope I wrote you before this that I have received the <u>enchanting</u>UmbrianCatalogue – I love it & have had <u>such</u> happy hours with it – I <u>love</u> everything you send me because you do not send me</p>
