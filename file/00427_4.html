<p>I backed one of Duveen’s games in connection with a small but wonderful collection of pictures here which they have been trying to buy through Langton Douglas who, I am sure, is under contract with them – I also queered their game with Lady Carlisle – They can do nothing now but pay her <u>full</u> price which will make them sick –</p>
<p>You know I wrote you that I want one <u>fine</u> early Chinese painting – not too technical & somewhat decorative – so <u>do</u> let me know if you come across such ask me if it is not aprohibitiveprice – I am surprised that noone [sic] here has gone in for chinese sculpture – I am going again to see the Stein things on Wednesday morning – Do write me a long steamer letter – Will write of course, up to the time I leave – don’t forget</p>
