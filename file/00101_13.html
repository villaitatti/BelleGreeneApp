<p>P.S. – I forgot to tell you that Blumenthal came in the other day with a tale that he had been approached by the government to give testimony against [<i>double underlined</i>: Seligmann] & that it promises to be as serious for Seligmann as it is for Duveen – Rey gets in on the Lorraine tomorrow. I <u>wish</u> I could go down to meet him but I don’t dare to if there is apt to be any</p>

<p>trouble. I sincerely hope he won’t be touched for I am [<i>double underlined</i>: so] fond of him – he wired me that he would come to see me directly from the dock so I will let you know what he says – he really is a [<i>double underlined</i>: dear] & I will do every thing I can to help him. –</p>
<p>J. P. promised me tonight that in case of trouble he would stand by</p>
