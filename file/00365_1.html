<p> <u>Friday noon</u> </p>
<p>Darling – this letter is not at all what I wanted to say to you, that is not all I wanted to say to you but for the past two days I have been tied up with Freer who is out here and this afternoon I am going back to Detroit with him to stay until Tuesday – He has over 100 <u>New</u> Chinese paintings!</p>
<p>I will tell you how he got them & write you all about them from Detroit – I miss you <u>so</u> much dear – I just can’t bear to let me mind dwell upon you too long – An Italian duke here tells me that Italy is going to war and he expects to be on the Austrian frontier on Feb. 1 – He looks like a barber & <u>I</u> think he’s a white slaver –</p>
<p>Ever your own Belle</p>
