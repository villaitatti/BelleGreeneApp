<p>days before I see you – and it seems <u>so</u> long – I thought it wiser not to write J. P. urging him to visit you as one can never tell in what mood <u>letters</u> will be received – besides I am a bit afraid of the “harem” with him. I think they would not hesitate to give me a push (and you too) if they had a perfectly good opportunity – I will write you a <u>real</u> letter by Saturday’s boat – Until then love me heaps and know that I love you – Glad you were so happy in Naples – Ever Your <u>Belle</u> </p>
