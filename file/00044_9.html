<p>you as the topic of conversation. I wonder if you will ever think of me again if you have made up your mind not to return to America? And why do you scorn us thus? – I am going down to Islip to spend the night, get up at five o’clock in the morning and motor over to the North Shore to attend The Vanderbilt cup race – I wish you were to be with me – in the train – at dinner – after dinner until the races are over & I am back here – Yours with an ocean of love & a kiss on each wave</p>
<p>Belle.</p>
