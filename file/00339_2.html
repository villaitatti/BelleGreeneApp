<p>pretty exact – Some day when we are alone together I am going to tell you about <u>that</u> time in my life – and some other times too – I read until 2 a.m. (finishing the book) and am pretty sleepy eyed this morning – Do you know Wells? – and have you read the book? It would be too frivolous for you I fear – I’d give a good deal to be with me or have you with me – I suppose there is not the slightest <u>idea</u> of your coming here this winter?</p>
<p>Wouldn’t it be fine to be together again as we were the <u>last</u> part of your stay here? We were <u>both</u> so stupid in the beginning – </p>

<p>Always Your <u>Belle</u></p>
