<p>The Spring is coming & it is getting into my bones – I <u>ache</u> for you – truly dear I do – That is <u>not</u> a mere figure of speech – I look at men I know and [<i>triple underlined</i>: hate] them – hate them for liking me even – hate them for being here when You are so far away – hate them <u>even</u> for shaking my</p>
<p>[p. 16]</p>
<p>hand – I want you and only you and I hate Every one who is near you – and oh! how I <u>envy</u> them – You really cannot guess – and it is so <u>very</u> far away – that September. <u>six whole</u> months –</p>
<p>Goodby <s>m</s> dear my love – I embrace thee & cover & smother thee with kisses – & snuggle up into your arms & am happy – until I awake & find it was a dream – I am forever & ever <u>your</u> Belle</p>
