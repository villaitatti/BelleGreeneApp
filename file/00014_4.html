<p>headlong I continue precipitously rushing forward through all manner of nettles and briars instead of keeping to the path – guessing at the meaning of unknown words instead of looking into a dictionary – tearing open letters and never untying a string expecting every thing to be done in a minute and the result is that I fall & scratch myself to pieces without accomplishing any more that ˆas much asˆ the Burne Jones angels who spend their time decorously wandering up and down stairs in immaculate robes.</p>
