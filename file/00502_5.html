<p>P.S – If you see Mr. Porter, as I am sure you have or will, will you thank him for me for the munificent gift of his 10 volumes, and say that I am waiting to write him, until I have finished the text? Meantime I am enjoying the volumes of reproductions <u>immensely</u> – Our poor frail Child – the ‘Art Studies’ magazine is coming out next month – It interests me less and less – but it is shameful that it should be so.</p>
<p>I hate having to go back to town next week “My sould [sic] is sick of the Highways of Seduction” – I long for a desert green island lost in the Pacific Ocean –</p>
