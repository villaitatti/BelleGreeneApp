<p>went to the tiles and bowls and pieces of tiles and bowls and that collection too, interested me extremely – It was dreadfully hard to drag him away or to shut off his flow of speech – I really <u>never</u> heard anyone talk to continuously, in so monotonous a voice or so unintelligibly by and bye I rather got used to and the <u>sound</u> of his talk * – it was like the drip drip of a fountain, so it did not bother me so much – at last I got him into the Bronze room and through that to his Kuan-yin <u>and</u> </p>

<p>I’m ashamed to say B.B. that although I still liked it <u>immensely</u> , it did not have the spell for me it had had even the day before – I <u>wonder</u> if it is the sort of thing that <u>does</u> lose it’s spell after a bit? He told me a long and interesting tale about Okakura having seen it in China etc. etc. & how Goloubeff had taken him by the shoulder and made him buy it when he hesitated. He said that it was hard for him to decide between the Kwan-yin & Wetzel’sStelaand so he was doubly happy when he made Wetzel buy theStela.</p>
