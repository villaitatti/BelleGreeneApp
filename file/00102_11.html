<p>around Siena & they had a fine time –</p>
<p>Did I tell you that Johnson of Philadelphia has been elected a trustee of the Metropolitan? I am so glad – I want very much for them to make Archer Huntington a trustee also but for some reason they fight shy of him. I’m glad you like him. I know him <u>very</u> slightly but like him also – Well</p>
<p>dear I must stop I’ll promise never to write such a gossipy letter as this again although I haven’t told you <u>one third</u> of the gossip I had a really <u>delightful</u> letter from your wife, saying she was much worried about your health – Do write me in detail about it darling – you know [^ <u>now</u> ^] how important you are to my life & I want you to take care of yourself as belonging to <u>me</u> – How I <u>hate</u> to have you so far away – I kiss you dear again & again. Belle</p>
