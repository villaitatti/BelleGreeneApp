<p>that you knew all about my future plans and that we had discussed them at length <s>an</s> hegasped & fell back limp – said he <u>really</u> could not understand us at all – I suggested he give up trying and allow you andI, theblessed privilege of paddling our own canal in the future. Then Ethel sent for me to come down in her stateroom and see the things you sent me – They are perfectly ravishing – I do love them all – especially the feel of them and I was not happy until I had taken off all my clothes with the exception of my shoes & stockings & put on that lovely black & gold thing right next to my skin – It has the most adorable feeling – it is so soft & clingy & makes me feel just like An Arab or Egyptian – or Persian cat! – I’m dreadfully sorry I can’t keepthem I shouldlove to wear them always when I am at home – but dearest I really cannot – I don’t know just what to do with them either. I thought of giving them to the Purser of the ship & asking him to deliver them in Paris – but then you may not be in Paris by the time he returned (Nov. 7 or 8th) so I have decided to keep them until I hear from you as to what you want done with them. I could send them directly to the “maison” from which you bought them if you like – or if you want to give them to someoneelse whichis more likely – I will send them to you at any address you like. I hope</p>
