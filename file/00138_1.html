<p>Tuesday <u>March 14</u> </p>
<p>Daarrling –</p>
<p>Only <u>yesterday</u> dear, did I get your dear letter of Feb. 26 – I could <u>beat</u> those P.O. people in Italy – It was such a dear letter & so filled with love for me - I had it brought over from the library to my house and</p>
<p>read it in bed where I had been brought from a tiny fainting spell - <u>Don’t</u> be be worried dear – the doctor examined me thoroughly last night & finds there is absolutely <u>nothing</u> the matter with me – I am simply worn out & nervously exhausted and he has insisted upon my staying at home at least <u>four</u> nights a week and that I have promised to do –</p>
