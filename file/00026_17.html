<p>ever said to any living being for I never discuss him & I play largely the part of simplicity to avoid an appearance of knowledge of him at all – but I know that you understand (much overworked word!) – I know that you – know that I want nothing from him but his friendship and that I turn aside all</p>
<p>the material gain that seeks to come to me through that – this I am sure you know and for this reason I can write you as I do – I would do any thing for him because I know he would never ask me to do any thing which was unworthy of him or of me –</p>
<p>After this nasty harangue do you still want to be friends with me? –</p>
<p>I wonder –</p>
