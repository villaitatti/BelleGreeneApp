<p> <u>ever said to any living being</u> for I <u>never</u> discuss him & I play largely the part of simplicity to avoid an appearance of knowledge of him at all – but I know that you <u>understand</u> (much overworked word!) – I know that <u>you</u> – know that I want nothing from him but his friendship and that I turn aside all</p>
<p>the material gain that seeks to come to me through that – this I am sure you know and for this reason I can write you as I do – I would do <u>any thing</u> for him because I know he would never ask me to do any thing which was unworthy of him or of me –</p>
<p>After this nasty harangue do you still want to be friends with me? –</p>
<p>I wonder –</p>
