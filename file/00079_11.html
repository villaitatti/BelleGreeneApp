<p>with you to comfort you & at least <u>tell</u> you how much I love you – I think of you Every minute & have to gulp occasionally & hold back the tears bymainforce – You are so interwoven with all my thoughts and feelings, you are</p>
<p>so much an integral part of me – that I seem <s>only</s> to breathe only through you – I want to hold you in my arms – beloved – I want to kiss your dear cheeks & your eyes & your mouth – I want to crush you with love and to go to sleep in your arms</p>
