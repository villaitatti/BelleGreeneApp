<p>hours that lie between us – how I wish I might gather them all up in my hand and through [sic] them over the edge of the world! –</p>
<p>How I wish that you might gather me up & take me to the Wood beyond the World where we two might learn to know life and each other – I am going out of town on Saturday afternoon stay until Monday morning. So if you decide on your plans wire me up to Saturday at 12</p>
