<p>I got to bed about 6:30 and slept until one when I got up to see Thursty off on the Cedric She is going to Naples first and then to Rome – The Palace Hotel – If you happen to be there you might go to see her. I do hope she will have a good time poor thing – She deserves it –</p>
<p>I received the photographs of your dining room & your study. What stunning photos they are! I am <u>so</u> glad</p>
<p>[p. 16]</p>
<p>to have them. I have not yet received the photos of the rest of your paintings and am most <u>anxiously</u> awaiting them.</p>
<p>I am all alone in the library now – not a soul to talk to except the working men – but it is a good thing for I have nothing to disturb my work – and I am refusing all luncheon invitations so as not to have that awful break in the middle of the day – Thanks</p>
