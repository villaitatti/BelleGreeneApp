<p>number of the bankers object to shipping it at all – The prices of all food stuffs here have risen tremendously and <u>I</u> think unwarrantably – it seems to me that it is simply a <u>grab</u> on the part of the retailers taking advantage of the War Scare even though it does not affect us – I am busy working on the Red Cross Committee when I get a minute free from here. I have been, here night after night as I find I can help him in <u>purely</u> "clerky" ways – that is having everything in readiness for them, getting stenographers & messenger loops & telephoning & such – of course nothing a 10 dollar a week person could not do – but he swears that it makes all the difference in the world and he has been <u>so</u> kind to me that I am more than delighted to help in this little way – I am <u>much</u> better and am taking salt rubs which are helping a lot –</p>
