<p>Museums sounds very interesting and I hope I shall have the time to carry it all out. I shall tell you – albeit with hesitancy & shameful blushes – that I shall have to give a small amount of time to <u>shoppin</u> g. I must get millions of things which I promised to take home to my family and also some winter clothes as I am virtually in rags which although commonly considered an insignia of virtue – are not conducive to a pleasant state of mind – I’m not so sure virtue itself is – However I have not tried it long enough to give it a fair chance – I saw Harris for a minute today and am going to see him tomorrow. I am going to see him tomorrow. I am rather cross with him as Yates Thompson told me he offered him</p>
