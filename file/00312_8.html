<p>American friends and I hope you <s>won’t</s>  <u>are</u> one – I know you are very powerful here, when you are a friend (I guess Joe <s>e</s> Duveen told him <u>that</u> ) – I told him that he was very much mistaken, that I had no influence at all – and that I could be a friend <u>only</u> to a man who was big enough to be sincere and loyal – we parted then and certainly I <u>never</u> want to see him again – He seems by the way to have become very friendly with Mrs. Otto Kahn – He said that she asked him to go with her to Gimpel to look at the Gentile da Fabbrriano [sic] – that it was a good picture but he <u>forbade</u> her to pay so high a price for it – I took him up on that & told him that wasn’t his <u>business</u> – all he had to say was whether it was a fine picture or not – he replied that he liked her so much, his [ <i>double underlined</i> : conscience]!?! would not allow him to have her “done” in that way – Trust me to manage that Gimpel hears that! And I’m going to put a flea in Joe Duveen’s ear too – It certainly is war between Sirén & me too – I am also so disgusted with Agoness that not even Read can make me see her again of my own accord –</p>
