<p>Benson gave me a copy of his catalogue which you also must have – Your name figures prominently under every picture – The only <u>cool</u> relation I have had was from Cook who sent me a <u>card</u> to Doughty House needless to say I shall certainly not travel all that way to see his collection especially as I have his catalogue.</p>
<p>A man here tells me that Augustus Johns wants to do a portrait of me & that he will write me – I’d <u>love</u> to have it but have not heard from him yet –</p>
<p>Would you care to write up the drawings in the so-called “Giotto” MS. I bought from Voynich & which you saw at Gruel? –</p>
<p>Now I <u>must</u> stop – I haven’t told you all the news but it is the first moment I have had for writing – How I [ <i>double underlined</i> : hate] to go back & how beastly tame it will all be – & I [ <i>triple underlined:</i> hate] being a <u>neutral</u> Devotedly Yours Belle</p>
