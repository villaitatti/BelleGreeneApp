<p>[p. 2]</p>
<p>the Library on his return visit –</p>
<p>(Right here, I want to say, read this letter to the "bitter end" before you form an opinion on him through me)</p>
<p>He evidently realized that he had got himself in rather bad with me, for on this visit, I find he has completely changed his tactics & method of approach. He told me quite frankly (and I believe him) that he is trying to make his <u>personal</u> self over and to eliminate as many as possible of his bad [^and offensive^] qualities – in consequence he has so much the bearing of licked dog that he is utterly tiresome.</p>
<p>As far as I have been able to learn, and I have tested him in countless ways very thoroughly, his <u>only</u> value lies in gathering and assembling notes and information about things. He will spend <u>months</u> reading through horrible little auction catalogues to find out if a book or art object, were in <u>some</u> sale at some sale at some time – Useful of course in its way.</p>
<p>I paid him a comparatively large sum of money, the first time he was here, to go through the early printed books & some others with me, to see if he could check up some of the, hitherto, unknown bookplates</p>
