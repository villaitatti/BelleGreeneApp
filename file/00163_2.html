<p>Much interested in your visitings with the Black Ethel – She’s pretty easy when you’re wise to her, isn’t she? She’s altogether a footless person anyhow and I sincerely hope that I’ll be miles on my way to you when she reaches these shores – I spent Sunday out in my shack</p>
<p>in Tokeneke and altogether had aboreing[sic] time which was the direct result of trying to avoid it – I took up with me Mr. & Mrs. Roberts, rather interesting people, she is the editor of a magazine called the Craftsman and he is one of the editors of the Literary Digest, then I also had Owen Johnson the son of your friend Robert</p>
