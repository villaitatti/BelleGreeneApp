<p>Henry will cool his heels up the river for some time I fear, unless he hasunusualgood lawyers – Everyone feels he has been treated badly butnooneseems willing to help him in any way <u>except</u> financially. I wasmuchworried about the Seligmanns at one time as theCustoms’ House people had been after Blumenthal to learn what he had purchased from Seligmann. But nothing new has developed</p>
<p>and as Rey has destroyed all his papers etc. I do not fearany thingin that quarter. However the whole business has slightly cooled off the “art-heat” here &nooneseems to be buying or selling anything. J. P. swears he willnever by[sic]any thingagain & I say “amen” but suppose we will have three “near” Raphael’s [sic] within a year – Helas!I am so rushed here that I rarely know whether I am coming or going & with it all seem to do very little worth while</p>
