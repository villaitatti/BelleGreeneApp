<p>Henry will cool his heels up the river for some time I fear, unless he has unusual good lawyers – Everyone feels he has been treated badly but noone seems willing to help him in any way <u>except</u> financially. I was much worried about the Seligmanns at one time as the Customs’ House people had been after Blumenthal to learn what he had purchased from Seligmann. But nothing new has developed</p>

<p>and as Rey has destroyed all his papers etc. I do not fear any thing in that quarter. However the whole business has slightly cooled off the “art-heat” here & noone seems to be buying or selling anything. J. P. swears he will never by [sic] any thing again & I say “amen” but suppose we will have three “near” Raphael’s [sic] within a year – Helas! I am so rushed here that I rarely know whether I am coming or going & with it all seem to do very little worth while</p>
