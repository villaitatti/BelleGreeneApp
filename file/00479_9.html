<p>Lamont, Davison et al are off “shooting their mouths”, settling, (in the newspapers) the President’s and all nations vexed problems, saving (or patronising?) all the “starving peoples” etc. J.P. is quietly, steadily, unswervingly <u>on the job – and</u> – it is “ the job” that makes it possible for these others to secure an audience – Don’t you realize that they are to a very large extent existing on his name (not his father’s alone, by a long bit) – flourishing under the protection of it? Isn’t their “importance” to a very great extent, if not entirely, as members of J.P.M & co?</p>
<p>Please do not think I underestimate <u>any</u> of them, least of all Stettinius – and I am, personally [ <i>double underlined</i> : devoted] to Davison – We are <u>real</u> pals – without reservations! and I would do much for him,</p>
