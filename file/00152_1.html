<p>May <u>16, 1911</u> </p>
<p>Daarrling –</p>
<p>Although I wrote you yesterday – I must write you again today as I have just been plunged in a fathomless sea of reminiscences by your cable from Siena</p>
<p>To think that you are there and without me – Do you remember the evening we sat out on the walls and looked back at the city silhouetted against the wonderful pink sky? I shall <u>never</u> forget those moments</p>
<p>I remember that there was a tiny bit of sadness mixed in our joy and that I wondered at the time</p>
