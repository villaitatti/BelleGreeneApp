<p>so desperately busy these last few days of J. P. that I fear I could not see very much of her – I think I can manage the situation – I don’t know whether she has yet heard from your sister – I imagine not as I have just received <u>your</u> letter – but she writes me charming letters – I think it much wiser for me to tell her than for someone else to don’t you? I shall tell her</p>
<p>[p. 10]</p>
<p>how much (but not in how many <u>ways</u>) I love you – I shall tell her the mental & artistic end of our days in Venice & Rome & Florence and I shall tell her that as far as I am concerned my happiness begins and ends in <s>my</s> your love – but trust me not to be drivelling or mawkish – I shall tell her “as man to man” and from what I remember of a talk we had in Boston</p>
