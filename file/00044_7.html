<p>Friday <u>Oct. 29</u> </p>
<p>I had just finished your letter yesterday afternoon when the Big Chief came in & refused to allow me to write another word so that I could not even address the envelope – for which I am now glad for I can tuck in this p. s. to tell you that I talked of you for <u>two</u> hours last night & I felt so <u>near</u> to you! I met a man whom I used to know years ago – by name Gardner Teall – I never paid any attention to him until last night at dinner with the Untermeyers your name was</p>
<p>mentioned & he said he had spent a day (or several days) with you at Settignano. I said nothing at the time but made a mental resolve to “attack” him later which I did – with such success that he came home with me & begged to come in for a few moments – and <u>then</u> we talked you, as I said for two hours – He is terribly enthusiastic about you & told me <u>all</u> about I Tatti – he is the first person I have met who has been there and he also said he met your friend Rembilinski at your house that day – You don’t know <u>what</u> fun it was – especially as I had to <u>pretend</u> to be interested in <u>him</u>  <s>to keepm</s> & still keep</p>
