<p>Dearest B.B –</p>
<p>I held my steamer letter open hoping to be able to add to it&send by the British packet –</p>
<p>but I have decided to send by the French line as then it will not be held up 4 or five days in England –</p>
<p>I have been kept in such a <u>whirl</u> ever since I landed that</p>
