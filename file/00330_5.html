<p>me – then to England & then a water trip through France – I shall have to bring my mother with me – but think I can deposit her somewhere en route. All this <u>provided</u> I can raise the coin as it will be a pretty expensive trip as there is no darling J.P. to put a sum at my disposal at Morgan Harjes – It seems pretty far in advance</p>
<p>[p. 10]</p>
<p>to worry about it all doesn’t it – but nothing else interests me so much now as this far off trip –</p>
<p>Goodnight you darlint – I hope I’ll be in a better mood for writing tomorrow –</p>
<p>I am</p>
<p> <u>Your</u> </p>
<p> <u>Belle.</u> </p>
