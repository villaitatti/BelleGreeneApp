<p>I had a note from Senda saying she was to be here till 21 & wanted to see me & talk to me about <u>you</u> – If she asks me any thing <u>direct</u> I shall have to tell her – no matter what she will think of me – that I love you <u>very</u> much & that I don’t believe we either of us can ever be <s>supremely</s> really happy apart – She <u>must</u> know <u>something</u> &c. – She would not have written me in that way so she may</p>
<p>as well know my side of it – do you mind? Even if she thinks I have no <u>right</u> to love you, she must know that he fact remains and I would not change it if I could – of course I can’t expect her to sympathize with me but if she asks me I shall tell her just the same – She will have to know it sooner or later for [ <i>double-underlined</i> : surely] the time will come when we shall be no longer separated –</p>
