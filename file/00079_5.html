<p>Peruginos & <u>lots</u> of other things which I am ashamed to say I cannot remember – then I went to hunt up Mons. Ugolini but could not find him so left my card & he called on me prompt & Early this morning – but I must not get to that part of my story yet</p>
<p>In the afternoon we went in your car to the</p>
<p>Villa d’Este and although I must admit to being disgusted with the interior I found the grounds a joy forever. We stayed there two hours and walked all through and around them and afterwards went around <s>Viterbo</s> in your car & saw the cascades & the Sibylline temples & got some fine views of the villa & surrounding country</p>
