<p>whom I would write in this seemingly wild and crazy way – we are having the [double underlined: vilest] weather. It has been snowing all the afternoon and now it is raining viciously – Heaven help this town if the rain does not continue – Do you remember that thing in theLute of Jade“The little rain”? – I love it Darlingest. I am so happy in your love and in my own reasoning and unreasoning love for you – I want to love you and be part of you always – and I want you to keep me always tucked away inside your heart and never let me get away from your life – I shall work hard until I see you on Friday. You know I <s>always</s> have a very strong feeling that I have to <u>earn</u> the right to be with you – will you give my love to Mary – the [double underlined: Peach] that she is – I love to be with her. Now she really <u>is</u> a life-enhancing person – Please wrinkle your nose B.B. – Your Belle</p>
