<p>I met Maeterlinck & his latest wife at the dress rehearsal of the Blue Bird the other day and later at the Blue Bird ball which Mrs. W.K. Junior ran – But each time I <s>am</s> was only allowed to say howdy so I have no impressions of him.</p>
<p>The place is full of natives of all countries and one does get a bit fed up with them as they are all over here for money – or to "get" <u>something</u> </p>
<p>I saw my dear Bettie Johnston a bit this time – She looked <u>too</u> dreadful when she arrived, but infinitely better by the time she left – She had on the most gorgeous string of pearls which I can bet did not come from Alan – Although I never met the gent, I know enough of their marital & other relations for that –</p>
<p>As I wrote you I am leaving here sometime between Feb. 15 & 21 – The boat schedule has not been finally arranged yet so I do not know just when I am sailing – I <u>may</u> have to land at Cherbourg in which case I will spend perhaps a week in Paris to get some clothes then go on down</p>
