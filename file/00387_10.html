<p>[p. 15]</p>
<p>they both wrote me the most awful <u>roasts</u> of it and in the most disgusted tone, As I wrote to Read if such effusions are the result of having a baby hands off for me! – I wonder if she dared to send you a copy! Thursty says she never wants to see her again as she has surely lost what little mind, sense and <u>humour</u> she ever had. I will <u>assuredly</u> talk to Duveen as you suggest – I’m having a mad flirtation with – Herbert Satterlee! <u>can</u> you imagine it? He’s quite brief now and sends me huge boxes of flowers almost every day. I have <u>quite</u> definitely decided, (after going through the Goloubev collection with a fine tooth comb) that I am <u>through</u> with Persian miniatures after the 15 century. That collection is a <u>mess</u> and I thank Gawd devoutly every day that I escaped it – It broke Harvey Wetzel’s heart when I first told him – but wonder of wonders when he was here last week</p>
