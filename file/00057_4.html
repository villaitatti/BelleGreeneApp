<p>generally happens that someone asks me to do something perfectly fascinating on Saturday or Sunday night. Unfortunately for me there is no end to fascinatingly interesting people in N.Y. & they keep me on the jump although as you know I care <u>nothing</u> for society <u>as such</u> â€“ I am now planning</p>
<p>to go to Hot Springs Va. on the 18th of this month for ten days & shall be back here on Tuesday the 29th. So will you please direct <s>my</s> your letters for that time</p>

<p>Hot Springs, <u>Va,</u> </p>
<p>as I am to be her guest for that time. I am</p>
