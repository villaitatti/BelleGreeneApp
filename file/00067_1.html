<p>Tuesday – June 7 –</p>
<p>My very great dear –</p>
<p>I am afraid, dreadfully afraid that you will think my love for you has changed because I have not written you for several weeks – but it has <u>not</u> abated <u>one iota</u> . I have been in a maelstrom of business, society and emotion for the past month and have</p>
<p>[p. 2]</p>
<p>been so whirled about that I have not had a minute in which to collect my thoughts or even to put the wild & scattered ones to paper –</p>
<p>As in the course of your 40 odd years you have probably been plunged into innumerable such you must forgive me and feel that I am kissing away any hard thoughts that my carelessness may have produced.</p>
<p>But today I was brought to a very sharp & decided stop</p>
