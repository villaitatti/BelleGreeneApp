<p>out tonight to stay with the Martin Littleton’s who have just returned from England where they have had a royal reception – I love talking with him, he is so clever & such a brilliant talker – She is naïve, an ingénue & rather amuses me – They have a charming place near Roslyn where we have a nice party with</p>
<p>[p. 4]</p>
<p>lots of talk. You would enjoy him, I know – I think of you so much & so often dear and I am so filled with joy that we have so much of each other in our lives</p>
<p>I feel that it is a very wonderful thing to have you love me and when we meet you will know how much I have longed for you – Write me soon & keep me close with you always, <u>night & day</u> </p>
<p> <u>Belle</u> </p>
