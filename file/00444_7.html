<p>I kept this open to see if I would hear anything from you by the steamers which arrived yesterday. Alas! Everyones elegant calligraphy except yours –</p>
<p>I have not seen Carl Hamilton being much too annoyed with his supine & wellnigh helpless clinging to Joe Duveen – He telephoned & I was <u>extremely</u> cool to him – He stopped in a few days later, but Thursty saw him, as I would not – He read her Mary's voluminous & exalted letter regarding the Northumberland picture & told her that he expected you all to stay with him in his apartment when you came over next year – It certainly would be most comfortable & convenient for you both & save you all the wear & tear & worry of hotel life.</p>
