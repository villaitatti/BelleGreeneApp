<p>aside from their little vanities, it's a most heart and soul satisfying place – I have already engaged rooms for the first two weeks in October and were it not that I ache for the heights and great spaces of Montana and Wyoming, I would come here for at least one month during the summer –</p>
<p>I will try to catch you by telephone at your hotel later in the day, to see if you would care to have me come down next Sunday night – it could not be for dinner, because there is only one train from here on Sundays and that gets me into New York at about 8:30.</p>
<p>The paper says that Harvey will probably get the London appointment – I know he has been telling everyone that it was offered to him – What an incredible outrage it would be – As an important (politically) Englishman said in Washington – "how would you like to have Horatio Bottomley sent to Washington?" – For some unknown reason, Butler ( <u>says</u> he) refused it – I was hoping that Root would be next on the program – It seems that we are in for a period of party "hooch" and at this time of all others!</p>
