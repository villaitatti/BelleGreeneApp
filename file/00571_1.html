<p>15 Aug. 1932</p>
<p>Dear B.B –</p>
<p>Thanks for your letter which reached me at Naples – It is a real sorrow to me that I will not be able to make Consuma(meaning <u>You</u> !) but my time, on land, is curtailed, as I am</p>
<p>[p. 2]</p>
<p>returning on the Augustus from Genoa on Sept. 2 – I took the trip almost entirely for the sea part of it – in order to try to restore, to even a slight extent my frayed body, mind and nerves – also to escape, if only for a moment, from listening</p>
