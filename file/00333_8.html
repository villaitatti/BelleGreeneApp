<p>live with you and then I’ll be nice again –</p>
<p>It’s a horrid day – all dull and grey and thick & stupid. I feel just as impossible and I think I’d better stop. I’m going to sell the head Read is sending me too if its [sic] any good but I bet it isn’t worth <u>$100.</u> and I wouldn’t be surprised if some dealer gave it to him or threw it in with some other purchases –</p>
<p>oh! what a beastie I am – I’m going out now to raise H____ somewhere and I feel sorry for any <u>nice</u> person that crosses my path –</p>
<p>I ache with longing for you – I dare say you’ve forgotten all about those _______ sweats??? <i>_____</i> </p>
<p>Your adoring [ <i>double underlined:</i> Belle]</p>
