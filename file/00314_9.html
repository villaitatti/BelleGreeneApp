<p>little marble head – which is by no means poor, but which I should not have bought – I <u>am</u> so sorry that you feel badly about my buying it, but darling I have had <u>such</u> joyous minutes already with that and my <u>jade</u> (my preshus jade!) I just sit down for a few minutes everyday, all alone with them and all the time I am loving them, I am <u>Youing</u> really & truly. There is only one thing more I ever want to own and that is a fine head – I’d sell my motor in a minute to get</p>
<p>one – <u>but</u> – a wonderful one!</p>
<p>Later 5 p.m –</p>
<p> <u>Such</u> a busy day, with shoals of people – Lunched with Mrs. Whiteside of Boston at the Colony Club – She had a Mrs. Vaughan of the Holy City & some other women. Do you know Mrs. Whiteside? She is a darling old lady and I quite love her. She invited me to spend a week with her in Boston at the end of May and I shall go, but of course, only for a few days – Mrs. Vaughn knew Langdon Warner very</p>
