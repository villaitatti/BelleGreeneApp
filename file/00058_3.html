<p>finish a miniature of me – and shall probably be back here on May 1st –</p>
<p>I am just off for the opening of the Academy so cannot write further. I will try to send you a line <s>by the Mauretania on</s> before I go South. Do you remember once saying you feared I would grow <u>“fat”</u> ? I now weigh 105 pounds as against 136 when I saw you. I like it, one gets around so much easier. Please mark all your letters [double underlined: Personal] as I shall leave word to have them forwarded wherever</p>
