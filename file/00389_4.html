<p>blue. It seems the stock market had been standing on its hind legs and pawing the air all day – I expect we will all be paupers in a week – I was with Forman just a few nights before he sailed and Quinn had invited me to dine with Hugh Lane the night before but I refused – I suppose <s>d</s> you received my cable that Frick had purchased the Bellini – so you will include it will you not in your articles – Frick is constantly asking me to come up and pass on his art objects – I go just to keep in with him, but it certainly is a bit clunky of him I think now <u>when</u> are you coming over? I have taken a house for the summer almost <u>in</u> the water, at a place called Sea Gate and have given up my two apartments for next year and leased for three years the tiniest house you can imagine in East 38 Street – my sister Ethel is to be married in July so we do not need so much room. I had intended to spend a good deal of money in doing it over but as I am afraid of hard times ahead now I will not do so – give my love to Mary & <u>much</u> much of it to you</p>
<p>– always your <u>Belle</u> </p>
