<p>Library & I feel quite an easy victim to some of the good looking officers – Saturday afternoon they all came up to a garden fête at Columbia which was most enjoyable – Do you know a Prof. Myers [sic] from the University of Liverpool? He & his frau have been over here rearranging & cataloging the Cesnola collection & I have seen a little of them. They are <u>most</u> interesting people & he amazes me by his general as well as his specific knowledge. If you do not know him already you must manage to meet him</p>

<p>you will find him enchanting. I have been motoring this afternoon with a dear boy who interests me keenly – Dick Forrest – he is going to Italy for several months this year & I am going to give him a letter to you – as I want him to know you – I wish I could put out my hand & touch you – & that you could put your arms around me – it is really aggravating to <u>know</u> that both are impossible at least for some time. You might as well be at the North Pole as to be in Italy; it takes <u>so</u> long for letters to come and go – so you really must write <u>twice</u> as often – must you not dear? – I love you & kiss you closely –</p>
<p>Belle –</p>
