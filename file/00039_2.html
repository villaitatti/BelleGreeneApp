<p>received today the list of Rembrandt etchings I have not had time to check it up – merely gave it a quick glance to learn that none of the big pieces I wanted were in the list. I will check it up & write to your friend by the next mail. I am much upset by the condition of my friend Junius Morgan. He has seemingly <u>exited</u> himself & for mostly imaginary reasons. He has virtually left his wife & children, resigned from all his clubs, closed up his business and gone – no-one knows where – I am truly and sincerely devoted to him and we have always been perfectly frank & openly confidential – he evidently has told me more of his troubles than anyone else & yet I feel as if I knew nothing, and he left me wondering – distinctly unhappy & very anxious about him. If you come across him let me know how he impresses you – whether he seems <u>physically</u> well and at all happy and contented. I had a <u>long</u> talk</p>
