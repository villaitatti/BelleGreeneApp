<p>of course I did not have it – He also brought a fine glass <s>Sun</s> Tang vase from Bahr and a <u>marvellous</u> collection of bronzes from Bing (via Loo)</p>
<p>I have bought two charming Ming lacquer tables from Loo. They are a lovely golden brown with green & dull red dragons battling back & forth across the top – also a Stone Wei figure and two T'ang barservers</p>
