<p>Have just left Ragusa which I <u>adored</u> – and almost stayed on shore for a few days – Tomorrow we stop at Brioni for an hour – but I am not going ashore as I flitted away a month there once and had enough – </p>
<p>I do not envy you London although I hear the people </p>

<p>are not so depression-crazed as are we in New York.</p>
<p>I dare say you will see the Duveens in their “lordly” manor house. I understood that the Metropolitan Museum was to bring some of Mackay’s paintings and tapestries at the meeting the day after I sailed, but I have heard nothing since – However the great Joe will dish you all the arty dirt. Thank Heavens I am out of it all for a few weeks at least.</p>
<p>I expect to stay in Venice at the Grant for about 6 days </p>
