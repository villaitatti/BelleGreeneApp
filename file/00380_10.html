<p>in two weeks when we expect to kill the town – now I <u>must</u> run – with just ten minutes to my credit – I’ll finish this at the Library in time to send it by Saturday’s boat.</p>
<p>Friday 6. p.m –</p>
<p>I had hoped to find a letter from you awaiting me – but no luck – Jack’s excitement was that the newspaper had got wind of the Chinese Porcelain sale and he was in a blue funk as they have not been appraised by the <u>state</u> yet and then would be an awful legal row on if it became known. I told him there was nothing to do but for <u>him</u> to refuse to see reporters, keep absolutely quiet and make <u>Duveen</u> (who had started the report) deny it – I called Chuck Henry up and swore we’d break the contract</p>
