<p>[written on diagonal in top left corner: Received today your letter of the 17 via the <u>K.K.K. Wilhelm</u> ]</p>
<p>Tuesday <u>August</u> 24</p>
<p>This is a desperate effort to catch the Mauritania. I received the photographs of you (from Florence) yesterday. I love the <u>actual</u> photograph. The painting is of some man I might have loved had I not met <u>you</u> first, and I am awfully glad I did not know you “aetas 21”!</p>
<p>Mr. Morgan returned to us (I nearly said to <u>me</u> !) this morning looking superbly well & in splendid spirits from his cruise.</p>
<p>Now that Harriman has returned – and not in a coffin –</p>
<p>the American public is permitting itself to draw a long breath. The way interest has been concentrated on his health and return from health-seeking is, I presume characteristic of the day, but utterly repulsive and disgusting to me. The poor foolish ones have wrecked the market and thereby ruined only themselves with their useless “Theories” guesses & fears as to what Harriman will do with the Pacifics’ finances in the existing posture of affairs</p>
<p>To me, the <u>only</u> interest converges on the question of how this quintessence of activity, this cunning yet gigantic schemer, will adapt himself to the remorseless programme of rest,</p>
