<p>thing I have and everything I can beg, borrow or steal but I had some experience with these "benefits” – What happens is that someone announces a Benefit performance at a theatre (Bessie Marbury is doing this right now!) – The tickets cost $5 apiece – After paying for the theatre, the company, the programs etc, the Belgian Relief Fund is netted <u>$99.69</u> – <u>and</u> all the women buy new evening dresses and new jewels</p>
<p> <u>because</u> everyone is to be there! The same applies to the Benefit Balls – and Fashion Fetes &Thèsdansantsand all the rest – I have rarely seen such elaborate gowns and jewels as have been worn to these things this year – The minute you appear at one, some old fool nails you and says “Isn’t it dreadful about Rheims! You know <u>I</u> have been there & <u>seen</u> the Cathedral”</p>
