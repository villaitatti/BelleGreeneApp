<p>My lasting remembrance of him is as he came into the Library on Christmas Morning – singing “O come all ye faithful” at the top of his lungs – throwing his hat and cane into the nearest receptacle (a porphery [sic] sarcophagus) and putting both arms around me and kissing me on both cheeks before the “dissenting” throng. It is a precious memory to me –</p>
<p>To have been so sure of his love and trust that I have <u>never</u> questioned it, gives me an inspiration for all the rest of my life – I shall be working <u>for him</u> , every hour of every day to come –</p>
<p>My wonderful life with him is with him now and will be buried with him – write me soon I am banking on you – Belle.</p>
