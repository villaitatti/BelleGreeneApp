<p>I went to a luncheon today in a grand mansion on upper Fifth Avenue which a quasi-friend of mine has just built. It was lots of fun because we were a perfectly irresponsible crowd – justwe twowomen & Percy Mackaye – Poultney Bigelow, Rann Kennedy & Oliver Herford & the [^only^] reason I have <s>even</s> mentioned it isto shock you by repeating Oliver’s latestbonmot. After luncheon, Mrs. Van Rensselaer took us over the new house, very grand & imposing & <u>very</u> </p>
<p>tiresome – In passing through her personal suite we came upon a large & elaboratebath roomwhose only ornament was a huge douche-bag hung on the wall – Oliver Herford & I, were in the rear, making nasty catty remarks about the house but when Oliver spied this bag, he raised his hands piously & said to me in a hoarse & overloud whisper “lest we <u>beget</u> ” –</p>
<p> <u>Are</u> you shocked? I <u>howled</u> !</p>
