<p>I have no intention of deciding hurriedly and so Hyvernat has agreed to wait until I am fully satisfied that it <u>cannot</u> be done here – In any case Hyvernat will be the Editor- in Chief and Chassinat the assistant. I expect to see about six men altogether. </p>
<p>Patriotism has <u>no</u> place in the matter. I despise drooling sentimentality – when arrayed against scholarship – <u>also</u>, I do <u>not</u> intend, if I can help it, that our publication shall be open to criticism –</p>
