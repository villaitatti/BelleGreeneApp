<p> <u>not</u> to have youexpertisethere as I fear you may think –</p>
<p>I sent you the de Meyer photographs today – Three of them – I had to cut off part of the mounting as it was too large to go through the mail. Will you please choose the one you like best, if any, and return the other two as they are <u>very</u> scarce – <u>but</u> ,daarrling, if you <u>really</u> like and want them all <u>do</u> keep them. I am afraid you will find them rather “posey”</p>
