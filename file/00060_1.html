<p>Easter Sunday – Mar. 27</p>
<p>My dear – my dear –</p>
<p>I am in the midst of a gay & giddy house party who I fear will put a sudden end to this letter in short order – I am stopping with Mrs. Warner Leeds who has a most enchanting place down here – Bobby McKee, Jack Cosgrave and Arnold Wood came</p>
<p>down with us and others have been arriving hourly – We really are having a gorgeous time practically living out of doors – Last night we all went for a moonlight auto ride which was <u>delicious</u> – The moon was full to overflowing and made the country wonderfully bright and enhanced the great shadows. Then we came back & danced until almost two o’clock</p>
