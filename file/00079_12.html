<p>I want to have you beside me when I am seeing things, to feel for your hand & find it – to take your arm – & totease you ever– Don’t think I am <u>complaining</u> I am not & I am really quite reconciled to the situation but the longing for you – the incessantdemandfor your presence – the voice that calls for you continually I cannot still.</p>
<p>I shall be anxious to hear your news of your little Sister, and hope all good things for her. I do hope for both her sake & yours that she will be able to return to America at once – Dearest – my-dearest I kiss you & kiss you & <u>kiss</u> you</p>
<p>Belle.</p>
