<p>Hurrah! it’s all settled and I have my 3 millions from Duveen – the documents were drawn up by 2 lawyers, witnessed by 2 attorneys and they can’t crawl out – and wonder of wonders we made an almost cash deal with them – 1 million down – 1 million April 10th and the next <u>August</u> – in the case of the last they can have the option of paying 5% from Aug. – to Nov. 3rd – Don’t you think that’s pretty good business? The collection cost 2,183,000 – including about $300,000 dollars worth in J.P.M’s old house and 2 red vases in the library worth $75,000 which are [ <i>double underlined:</i> not] included in the price – so I think we scored – If I had put them up at auction of course I should have had 4 millions or over – but then there was the <u>chance</u> , slight as it may be of the dealers getting together etc.</p>
