<p>Feb. 29 – 1916</p>
<p>Dearest B.B. – </p>
<p>I have no "moral" right to write to you today as I am bound heart, hand & mind by the blues, I have no desire but to creep off into a hole in the ground & die there: the war situation is so <u>terrible</u> – Verdun practically held – the loss of La Provence just reported</p>
<p>[p. 2]</p>
<p>and the frightful situation in which Germany's new submarine policy has placed this country & at so critical a time Congress (or part of it) has revolted from the President's policy! Heaven knows I do not want war for America <u>now</u> – if the Lusitania or Belgium had been made the issue and we had gave in at that time, it would have been unfortunate but at least with reason and of some value perhaps</p>
