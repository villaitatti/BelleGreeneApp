<p>Dear, I <u>don’t</u> want to be <u>preachy</u> but I am so serious about all this – I <u>don’t</u> want you to become <u>in</u> growing – I want you to <u>love</u> every body&then everybodywill love you – Why I am surrounded by love on all sides, simply due <u>j’en suis sûre</u> to the fact that I love you so fully, so utterly, so gloriously – <u>Lots</u> of people have told me lately that</p>
<p>[p. 8]</p>
<p>I seem so <u>radiant</u> & so <u>glowing</u> – it’s simply because my love for you fills me & oozes out of my pores & shines through me <u>gloriously</u> I <u>know</u> that is it – I <u>know</u> that is the great secret & receiving love is to have it in you so that it overpowers those who come near you and I want <u>every</u> bodyto love [ <i>double underlined</i> : you] daarrling – <u>every</u> body</p>
