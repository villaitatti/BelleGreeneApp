<p>Dear B. B –</p>
<p>I received your letter of the 13th just as I was about to post the enclosed –</p>
<p>As you may not be in or near Florence until the 20th – I will go to the Grand Hotel there and do some sight seeing – Then will do anything you want ( <u>really</u> want) me to for a few days – You</p>
<p>[p. 6]</p>
<p>evidently did <u>not</u> receive a letter I wrote you from Paris saying that I was going to Rome for a week and would come on to Florence then –</p>
<p>In any caseletme know at the Grand Hotel, Florence what – if anything – you want me to do from about the 21 to end of July</p>
<p>[ <i>in print</i> : LOVE]</p>
<p>Belle</p>
