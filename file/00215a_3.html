<p>& I hope I may get a chance to admire it upon my return.</p>
<p>I saw Anne Morgan today at the Salon d'Automne. She looks well but the exhibit is something fierce. What a bad joke those cubistes are & Matisse has exhibited some pictures which are indeed not fit for publication. Remember me please to Mr Morgan & believe me, with kindest regards</p>
<p>Faithfully yours</p>
