<p>She spent most of the time telling me what a wonderful person she was & how every one of any importance (especially in the art world) was her <u>intimate</u> friend (I think you were one of them as I remember) I said little to her & listened amusedly; and learned later that she had told me <u>many</u> untruths & that many of the people she claimed to know so well did not know <u>her</u> at all – I do not know any one who knows her. She told me Fry was at her feet most of the time but as he had gone abroad when I returned I have never been able to learn if that too was part of her vivid imagination. She claims Mrs. Gardner as her soul-mate & I had lots of fun teasing her about Mrs. G. – I said all sorts of nasty things which riled her & told her that everybody that <u>I</u> knew thought Mrs. G. impossible <u>socially</u> & she immediately replied that I <s>di</s> couldn’t know any body of importance as she was the social leader of Boston & America –</p>
<p>As to her work I know nothing as I can find no-one of <u>my</u> acquaintance who knows her – but she virtually told me that she <u>wrote</u> all of La Farge’s</p>
