<p>[p. 5]</p>
<p>letter & hope that by this time you have mine – Dear you are in my heart of hearts & my love for you makes me laugh & sigh & weep & There are so many enchanting things about you – I am <u>so</u> relieved to find that <u>at last</u> you have <u>someone</u> to help you – How I wish <u>I</u> could – Will you <u>hurry</u> up & get well & strong dear? If I could</p>
<p>[p. 6]</p>
<p>hold you in my arms as I did in Munich one never-to-be-forgotten night, I am <u>sure</u> you would – I am rushing to dress for dinner now & will not go to supper after the play but will come home & read my itinery [sic]. I <u>know</u> you will feel the joy in my heart & the sob in my throat as I read – I shall love you forever – (That’s a [<i>double underlined</i>: threat]!) How I love you dear lamb [?], your dear dear eyes & your precious mind & body. <u>Your</u> Belle</p>
