<p>grudgingly admitted the most interesting person in New York, for it’s about all they seem to talk about – C’est à rire– You know perfectly well, B. B. daarrling, that I get “hipped” on <u>some</u> man, regularly every six months and I suppose</p>
<p>it will be so until I die – <u>but</u> I get over it all so <u>very</u> quickly that it does not really disturb the actual current of my life at all – And B. B. daarring, these men & this talk & all is so <u>stupidly</u> unimportant & irrelevant – the only time I was <u>really</u> “scandalous” was in your own dear company so</p>
