<p>Saturday Nov.</p>
<p>Dearest B.B –</p>
<p>First of all it is snowing lightly & <u>freezing</u> everymorn except in this house and it makes everything look <u>too</u> beautiful for words – <u>You</u> probably are used to seeing deep green grass & trees full of yellow and red leaves with <u>niches</u> of snow upon the ground but I am not & it simply intoxicates me – And I am enamouredof the Holfords which further</p>
<p>intoxicates me – They are too charming & adorable for words & the most delightful hosts – Even if possible</p>
