<p>Florence – do angel try not to be impatient &supercilious– you <u>never</u> were with me but you know you can be with some people – Mary, I know will be the dear she always is – she is <u>too</u> wonderful – I think of her <u>so</u> often & wish I could grow up to be like her – I always wanted to talk to her more but alas! we had little chance – I shall stop now love and write more tomorrow – I am a bit</p>
<p>distressed about my apartment for now that I have the furniture in it looks so tiny & will really <u>only</u> hold two – you & me – <u>us</u> – but that is one, isn’t it? I never was any good at mathematics – It has cost me <u>much</u> more than I expected so I shall have to leadthevery simple life for the next six months – Did I tell you I had a “raise” in my salary for the New Year? I am now the proud recipient</p>
