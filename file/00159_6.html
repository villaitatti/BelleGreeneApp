<p>the Black Ethel in which she complained bitterly of my neglect & wanted to know what the trouble was & said she would rather have it out than be in this suspense –</p>
<p>I wrote back a soothing syrup letter & told her I loved her as I <u>always</u> had & always would but that I was a beastly</p>
<p>correspondent as <u>any one</u> could tell her – You will probably have seen her by this time – I will write you from the train daarrling – I am glad you are so well and so happy but <u>don’t</u> be so happy that you forget [ <i>double underlined</i> : me]</p>
<p>I love you dear – more than ever – soon I will be telling you in your ear. Ever <u>your Belle</u> .</p>
