<p>now we have discovered we have no <u>end</u> of mutual friends I shall probably always be in touch with her – I will try to write you tomorrow & will write you on the boat It is ridiculous [^for^] me to have to tell you that <u>everything</u> you write me is of interest & that I want to hear from you as often as possible – I had a dear cable from J.P. which I confess made me rather homesick. I shall be glad to get back to him – very glad & shall doubtlessheatwell & strong in the sun of his affection – Why he loves me the Lord only knows but I am sufficiently grateful for the fact & ask no explanation. I’m sorry you didn’t come here – but I daresay <u>you</u> know best Belle</p>
