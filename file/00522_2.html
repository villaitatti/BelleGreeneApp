<p>long as it’s <u>somewhere else.</u> </p>
<p>New York is indescribably, incredibly nightmarish – Every street is being torn up – and on every block, houses are being torn down or literally, <u>thrown</u> up!</p>
<p>The dirt, and above all the noise is simply maddening – To step into the street, from the Library, is like stepping into a boiler factory from an oasis-in-the desert. Really and truly the place is no longer human – It’s just a huge noisy, grating and grinding machine & one can almost <u>hear</u> it</p>
