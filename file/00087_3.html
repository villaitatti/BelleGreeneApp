<p>Sane and practical, without reference to my own or your feelings in the matter. I leave here Wednesday morning about 9 o’clock for Southampton to catch the Oceanic –</p>
<p>I wriggled with joy when I heard of Ben Duveen’s arrest in New York & when I read this morning that “Uncle”</p>
<p>Henry had also been nabbed on the Lusitania I googled – You see what a nasty disposition I have. Unless I have a telegram from you this afternoon which may detain me I shall go down to the country late this afternoon to spend Sunday with the Yates Thompson’s – I shall return here Sunday night about 9 or ten</p>
