you I would very seriously consider coming here in September or October for surely, even if the war is ended by then, there will be no travelling possible in Europe – Of course if you could quietly and peaceably settle down to work in your own Villa that is a different matter – but for a “practical” dreamer as you are, I doubt if there is much room in Europe. I am <u>quite</u> recovered now dear and am taking exceeding great care of myself – I <u>cannot</u> tell you how excited I am at the possibility of your coming over here – I want you so much – but of course <u>that</u> is not sufficient reason – at this time of the year I could very probably get away for a <s>while</s> week or so & we <u>could</u> take a little trip – Let me hear soon darling & cable me <u>as soon</u> as you decide – Your <u>very</u> most devoted <u>Belle</u></p>
