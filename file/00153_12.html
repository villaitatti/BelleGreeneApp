<p>Friday to Monday with mother and my latest beau – a man named Baird – I don’t know whether I ever wrote you about him. I’ve seen a great deal of him simply because he happened to fit in with my reform movement – He is <u>very</u> quiet <u>very</u> serious, <u>very</u> calm </p>
<p>[p. 24]</p>
<p><u>very</u> studious and very much wrapped up in his work – in fact <u>every thing</u> I’m <u>not</u>. He is a corporation lawyer and very solemnly offers me his hand & small fortune (never says any thing about his <u>heart</u>!) once a month. I’m so used to it now that I will really miss it when I give him his real bounce – Mother</p>
