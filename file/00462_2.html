<p>to die of inanition. Please Gawd.</p>
<p>I have been exhausted by the Xmasnoises and festivities in this house for the past few days – Endless young people (young in comparison with my aged self) have arrived and danced & trimmed trees – or rather trimmed <u>a</u> tree various times & turned things upside down generally –</p>
<p>The Family Dinner – 12 strong – nearly killed me – I went to bed immediately afterward with an opiate – and did not recover until afternoon on Sunday –</p>
<p>I have written "thank you" letters until I am (mentally) tongue tied & my right arm paralyzed –</p>
<p>To Hell with the Merry Yule Tide!</p>
<p>I am glad that you find Mrs</p>
