<p>causes for delight is the fact that I must <u>perforce</u> get rid of 3/4 of my junk as there is no room for it in this new house – I’m overjoyed as I hate 99% of everything I have accumulated.</p>
<p>Now I must be off</p>
<p>Please don’t <u>ever</u> , for a minute doubt how much I love you, dear dear B. B – It is really – without <u>any</u> exaggeration the one deep and abiding feeling of my life – there is scarcely a day goes by without my thinking of you <u>always</u> , it seems to me – you have not really anything to complain of except my not writing often enough – and if you really believe how much I love you – how <u>much</u> my real life is living in <u>you</u> , the writing would not matter I kiss you parlantYour [ <i>double underlined:</i> Belle]</p>
