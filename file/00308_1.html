<p>Friday <u>morning</u> Apr. 17</p>
<p>Hello you dearest –</p>
<p>Such a day – such a day – It is too wonderful</p>
<p>“The sun is warm, the skies are clear” and for me the whole universe is dancing – I want to go out and play in this heavenly weather and certainly shall later on – I wish you were here – we would motor down to Long Island for luncheon and then go away off somewhere for a long long time.</p>
<p>Went to luncheon yesterday with a friend of mine, almost sixty who looks certainly not more than 40 – at the Ritz – a Mrs. John Carter Brown of Providence. She is austerely witty and above all a grande dame of the Colonial type – she made many and caustic remarks about the various ladies “in reduced circumstances” at the Ritz which amused me mightily</p>
<p>After luncheon I took her to Knoedler’s where she bought some Rembrandt etchings and two Seymour Hadens – It was well that I went with her for <s>she</s> her eyesight is not so good.</p>
