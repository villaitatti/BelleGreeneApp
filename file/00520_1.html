<p>Monday August 17 –</p>
<p> <u>Midnight</u> </p>
<p>Dear B.B –</p>
<p>I was in the midst of writing a far-too-long delayed letter to you, when I received a call telling me of Mrs. Morgan’s death, and I had no heart left for anything – I felt so broken-hearted for J.P – He adored her, as one</p>
<p>only should adore God – and she felt just the same way about him – I am trying to get a passage back to the Olympic, day after tomorrow – and failing that will take the Lapland on Friday the 21 –</p>
<p>Marie-Louise says she wrote you that I was taken ill on the train from Florence to Paris</p>
