<p>Tuesday morning <u>June 23</u> </p>
<p>Darling – This morning I quite unexpectedly received your letter of June 9th-10th telling of the horrible time you are having with strikes – By the same mail I received ones from Hyvernat and father Ehrle relating similar trying experiences at Rome – I did not think that the Italians could make such a <u>concerted</u> move – I do</p>
<p>hope you got away to Paris safely – I <u>wish</u> I had asked you to cable me so that I could be assured of your safe departure. I had a letter from Mrs. Strong yesterday saying she was going to spend a few days with you – I hope she told you the reason of her curious attitude toward me. I am not fool enough to believe it was genuine admiration and liking</p>
