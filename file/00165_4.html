<p>but I feel that I <u>must</u> know something of Spain – My ignorance is <u>too</u> appalling. J. P. did not bring back much of very great interest with him. He left all the enamels that I was crazy to see in London – I will see them however, and I hope with you, when I go over – His Egyptian stuff was more or less punk as even <u>I</u> could see – but then you must remember that he had noone with him</p>

<p>I am glad to say that we do not fear now that he will have to goin thewitness stand in the Steel Investigation. I think that as far as J. P. is concerned they have come to their senses but of course one can never be sure – I hate to think of him standing before thosewhipper snappers– of course it is all <u>purely</u> political and mainly intended to discredit Roosevelt –</p>
<p>I am so glad that the fall is coming. I do not remember when I have hated a summer as much as I have hated</p>
