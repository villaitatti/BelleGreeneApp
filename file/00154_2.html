<p>article that I was very quiet – & self-contained yet this picture was of half actress and half college girl – It really is <u>too</u> mean of them. If I behave in a dignified way when attending to my business why can’t they treat me in the same way in their newspaper or better still why <u>can’t</u> they leave me out? I was so cross that it has given me a violent headache & so I am spending the morning in bed much to poor Baird’s disgust who wants me to golf with him. I feel “mean” all over – Do you know what that feeling is? I <u>wish</u> you were here daarrling</p>
<p>It seems so long to August and appallingly long to November. Belle</p>
