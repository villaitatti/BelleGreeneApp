<p> <u>only</u> reason I want to get abroad is to see you – If it were not for that I would not attempt to go now as I detest the ocean trip & can stay so <u>short</u> a time that it really does not seem worth while. But I <u>do</u> want to see you</p>

<p>And it would be a splendid time of the Year for us to be together without prying Americans around –</p>
<p>I fear I could only see you in London & Paris for I would not be able to stay more than a week after the sale (which would be Dec. 1) It would not bevery <u>too</u> satisfactory</p>
