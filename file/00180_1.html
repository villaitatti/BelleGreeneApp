<p><u>Tuesday</u> Jan. <u>9, 1912</u></p>
<p>Dear dear B. B. –</p>
<p>This is the first time in six months that I have ever had <u>leisure</u> to write a letter. To be sure there are millions of things that I might, could or <u>should</u> be</p>
<p>[p. 2]</p>
<p>doing at this moment, but fortunately there is nothing more important that I <u>have</u> to do than writing you to and J. P. by the Lusitania – and I have dedicated the rest of this afternoon to those two jobs –</p>
<p>I am <u>so</u> glad, you</p>
