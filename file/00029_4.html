<p>But nevertheless we all had a bally good time, we stayed over until after class day on Friday & you never saw a more completely exhausted human being than I was on Saturday – We spent most of the day at “spreads” – the Hasty Pudding in the morning, Pi Eta in the gymnasium & the nicest of all – the Book Spread in the late afternoon in their lovely Hall – They had the Class Day exercises in the stadium – and the Joan of Arc</p>
