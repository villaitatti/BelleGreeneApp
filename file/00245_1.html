<p>Thursday <u>Sept. 4, 1913</u></p>
<p>Dear B. B. –</p>
<p>You and your Mrs. Wharton seem <u>terribly</u> far away! – (Hope you notice the jealous note!) – I am up to my ears still in work – but every once in a while I stop and remember that you are actually coming over this winter. I can hardly believe it and am really excited.</p>
<p>I wonder if you</p>
<p>[p. 2]</p>
<p>are planning to go to Boston the same day you land – <u>also</u>, I wonder if you would like to go (both of you) there in my car or if you prefer the train.</p>
<p>The trip is a rather long one in the car unless you stop over somewhere for the night, but the train I think is horrid and this last terrible wreck onthe New Haven may have made you nervous –</p>
<p>There is, of course, plenty of time to let me know</p>
