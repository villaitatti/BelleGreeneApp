<p>you. She’s an awfully amusing hawg as you know – I hope you also know (& thus are prepared to be ‘wily’) that she is utterly unscrupulous – has a vile, blackmailing tongue – is harder boiled than any egg known to mankind – and is <u>wholly</u> occupied in grasping and getting everything she can – and leaving the whitened bones of her victims to rot afterwards –</p>
<p>She has tried her best to make up to me (for these same purposes) but except for seeing her once at the Ritz, I won’t have anything to do with her –</p>
<p>I saw Forbes for a few minutes in Paris – Sachs was coming up from <u>some</u> ‘les bains’ to join him – and I believe they were then going off to Italy – so you have probably seen them by this time.</p>
<p>Marie Louise left me in Paris, to join her mother at Geneva and go on to Aix. She was howlingly funny about Nicky being convinced in her own mind that dear Nicky was the Lesbian <u>plus</u> – that you thought M-S. was! I am more and more convinced that most of our friends and acquaintances are sexually unsatisfied and hungry – which makes them avidly suspicious of the sex life</p>
