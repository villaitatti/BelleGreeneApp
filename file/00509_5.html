<p>I’ve been seeing shoals of interesting people from all over Europe (largely England) this year – and we’ve had – or are going to have all of the art critics – museum directors and sich of the world, before it is ended –</p>
<p>Friedländer got along extremely well with everyone – I liked him too – A poor, wobbly woolly old dear from Buda Pesth [i.e., Budapest] wandered in the other day – one Dr. Therry – <u>How</u> do they get that way in life?</p>

I simply cannot see it – that is Botticelli in it.</p>
