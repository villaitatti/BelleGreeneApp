<p>Dear B.B. –</p>
<p>Our telephone conversation yesterday was so unsatisfactory that I want to send you this line immediately upon my arrival here – mainly to explain that my [^last^] letter was not intended as a horror – Your wire did not intimate that you</p>
<p>[p. 2]</p>
<p>found it so and then over the telephone you insisted that it was "horrid" – I <u>am</u> sorry because my idea in writing was to clear away the debris instead of piling more on –</p>
<p>You see, my dear, [^daily^] letters are dangerous weapons or instruments unless the correspondents are au fond in harmony. They are so easily misread and the spirit misconstrued.</p>
<p>Mine was a call to arms that we might have peace –</p>
<p>I thought the time had come when we ought to be constructively</p>
