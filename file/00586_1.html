<p>[ <i>written in top margin:</i> Love to Nicky ( <u>not</u> P.S. Love!)]</p>
<p>Dearest B.B. –</p>
<p>I cannot tell you how <u>wild</u> with jealousy I am that you and Nicky are in that wonderful Ragusa – I spent 2 hours (it seemed to be 2 minutes) there, one time when I was on a</p>
<p>Vulcania cruise, and every year I have promised myself to go back and stay forever – in any event, for the Summer –</p>
<p>I am excited to know that I <u>may</u> see you – if only for a day or two, in Salzburg – that is <u>if</u> I can get rooms anywhere! (my nephew Bobbie is with me) – I took tickets for the <u>last</u> week in August (alas!) as then, I had planned to go on</p>
