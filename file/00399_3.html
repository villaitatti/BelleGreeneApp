<p>hang on here for the mere salary, so much longer than I want to or had expected to. <u>Please</u> do not breathe a word of this to anyone, especially the Eugene Meyers – I am sure this "awful" secret is safe with you – Now no more of that and above all do not worry on my account a single minute – after all I am still alive & fairly healthy & things could be much worse – While writing the above I received your</p>
<p>letter of the 13th from Rome. I do not know how or why it is that my cable took so long to reach you – I'm frightfully sorry dear, that you have waited so long for a letter – and I suppose that the slow & irregular mails delay my letters a great deal also – I think I told you in my last that there is now no hope of my getting over – the State Department is withholding all transports</p>
