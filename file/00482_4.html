<p>[p. 4]</p>
<p>thought of him (this was while you were here) I said I did not know as you had not even <u>mentioned his name to me</u> (this was before I forced you to do so – your <u>active</u> silence about them, after meeting them at my house, had highly amused Miss Thurston and myself, until I decided I wanted seriously to know just why you were so crazy about him) I find his wife a bit difficult to swallow more than once a year and have not seen her since you left.</p>
<p>Your praise of him ought to be very helpful to him, for he is at the turning point here now and I hear much criticism of his work – Unless he developes [sic] something entirely new or progresses along the line of the Rockefeller bust, his vogue <u>as a sculptor</u> is practically over. Entre nous – <u>strictly</u> – the J.P.M “memorial” will some day be quietly removed to a less conspicuous place in the Museum if not to the cellar – <u>Personally</u> , he is sweet.</p>
