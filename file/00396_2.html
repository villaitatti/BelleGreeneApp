<p>all or rather the few things outside of my work I have been doing – I don't quite know what started it. Sometimes I think (or feel sure) that it was the result of our trip to Freer's & that glimpse of Chinese living & art which has taken such an extraordinarily unrelenting grip upon me – I have longed to be alone a great deal to do nothing but think – not really even that — to be more or less <u>non-existent</u> sometimes I have felt that it <s>much</s> must be a psychological effect of the war – and that too is curious – for there is hardly a moment in which I do not <u>feel</u> the war – and yet I have never a desire to discuss it rather to the contrary – and then somewhere I read that in the course of every seven years of one's life, there comes to vibrant people an almost entire change – To be horrid and vulgar I feel as if I had lived through the <u>physical</u> "change of life" which comes to all women, – [^ <u>but</u> ^] spiritually can you <u>possibly</u> understand me? I fear</p>
