<p>January, 6 April 1926 –</p>
<p>B.B. Darling,</p>
<p> <u>What</u> a hissy, spitty the-God-of Moses letter you wrote me last time! I laffed & I laffed and wisht I was there to make snasties at you –</p>
<p>Wisht I was there – <u>ennyhow</u> – I’m so sick of New York and all suchfurrincities – I haven’t seen the sky since I left Europe – nor anything beautiful</p>
<p>– nor anything divinely mysteriously dark like the lower church at Assisi, nor anything divinely perfect likeTodi, sitting there so utterly <u>It</u> – And I’m so hungry for it all – butso poor – that maybe I'll never see any of it again – or if I do it will be because I’m being ‘kept’ at it – at the moment I see no other way of getting & staying there at all this summer –</p>
<p>I’ve been in bed since 4 o’clock today – resting up from a blow that God has</p>
