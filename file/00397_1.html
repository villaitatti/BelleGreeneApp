<p> <u>Thursday</u> – Feb. <u>17</u> – 1916</p>
<p>Dearest B.B. –</p>
<p>I have just put everything aside in the midst of this frightfully busy day to send you a line – I can't always do it however – Since I last wrote you I have been warned on every side that it will be pretty difficult & "laborious" for me to get over to Italy. I shall not, however, pay any serious attention to anybody until I consult the Dept. of State authorities – They will know the real conditions better of course. I should <u>so</u> much like to go over, both to see you and to get away from this nerve racking existence here –––––––</p>
<p>I was interrupted here by a visit from a Mrs. Wolcott of Buffalo who fell upon my neck & said she knew all the men I had been in love</p>
