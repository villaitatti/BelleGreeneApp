<p>Annie – Daarrling didn’t you <u>know</u> I loved you just the same, that it was only because I wanted to give every minute & every thought to that poor little black thing who had been <u>more</u> than a mother to me – Didn’t you guess how often in all those horrible days I wished and prayed for you to be with me – And when it was all over & the poor dear little thing was laid away I was a physical wreck – Daarrling she loved me so much – in a different way from you – in a <u>slave’s</u> way or a dog’s way – something quite outside of human love she gave me & now I have no-one but you to love & to love me & daarrling I <u>cling</u> to you <u>so</u> can’t you feel it? – can’t you feel that my world ispeopledonly with you? – If I could be with you one second you would know – I would <u>make</u> you know – one <u>second</u> </p>
