<p>so near me and that it will not be so very long before I may feel your dear loving arms around me – You mean so very much to me dear – I could not have believed it possible that anyone would become so much a part of <u>me</u> and my life as you have – and how glad I am – how I rejoice in the fact that I no longer belong to myself but to you and that henceforth</p>
<p>my life will be lived in and through and with you – even if we are separated by miles – The memory of all our precious hours is always with me and like a rosary I count them over Every one of them –</p>
<p>Goodnight darling <u>dear</u> – I kiss you dear & hold you close to me – thank the Gods I shall soon do so again –</p>
<p>Ever & forever [underlined three time: and] a day</p>
<p>Your <u>Belle</u> </p>
