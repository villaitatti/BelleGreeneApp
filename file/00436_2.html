<p>with age – just as I know that <u>all</u> my philandering (to put it mildly to myself) has not changed the real me at all – Even if perhaps it has scratched & muddied the surface –</p>
<p>Am <u>so</u> glad that Maryis quite well again –</p>
<p>Write to me as often as you are not cross or discouraged with me –</p>
<p>I will try to send a real letter soon – I'm done up to day having attended an all night party given to some returning "heroes" Must admit that I'm pretty well fed up with heroes & uniforms –</p>
<p>I'd really like to hug & kiss you –</p>
<p>Ever yours <u>Belle</u> </p>
