<p>able to fully realize when there was a time in which I indulged in such empty amusements. I have not only not <u>written</u> to Read (although he writes me regularly) but I honestly only think of him when I receive a letter. – Now – it is all so <u>utterly</u> different with you – and do, for gods sake believe me quite finally – for otherwise there can be no reason for my writing all this to you. Here, there has been no time when I have not completely consciously and wholeheartedly</p>
<p>loved you – you enter into really every phase of my living – When I quite go raving stark mad over some work of art (generally Chinese!) I <u>Ache</u> to have you with me – to have you beside me, vibrating <u>with</u> me – and then talk it all over with me afterwards Perhaps you cannot reconcile this to my not writing – but <s>it is</s> the <u>fact</u> of it, is one of the greatest things I <s>have</s> got <s>ten</s> !! out of my "retreat" the fact that you belong in my <s>e</s> very existence – that I do not <u>need</u> the recalling</p>
