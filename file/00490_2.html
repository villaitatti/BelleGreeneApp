<p>Dear B.B. –</p>
<p>I am sending you 4 photographs/ of The New York Historical Society’s “Triumph of Fame” panel –</p>
<p>As I am only allowed to send 1 photograph in a package, you will receive (I <u>hope</u> ) 4 packages/ –</p>
<p>I think they are very good. The first lot did not suit me and I had them done over.</p>
<p> <u>Belle</u> </p>
