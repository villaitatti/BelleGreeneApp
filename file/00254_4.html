<p>You know I told you I had “thrown them down” and how they had assembled most of the guests by telling them that <u>I</u> was to be there, which made me pretty sore – Well both Owen and Esther called me on the telephone yesterday with despair and tears in their voices, and said they would be ruined, if I did not come etc etc – Owen even went so far as to say that I need never see or speak to them again if I would only show up tonight – so I said that I would but that I would never forgive them. It’s too disgusting and I shall be quite horrid and sniffy & cool at the dinner – My love to Mary and you – How is your halo? – Belle</p>
