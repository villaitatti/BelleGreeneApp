<p>with you will feel the glow and send back waves of love to you in return – All the world <u>must</u> love you and envy <u>me</u> for having all of your love – Daarrling – I am going now to a giddy all night New Year’s Eve party but I shall go happy, for I have spent these hours <u>alone</u> with you – oh! it is <u>splendid</u> – I feel so close, so <u>near</u> to you love – I feel wrapped in your dear arms & in your heart – I feel so confident that <u>nothing</u> can separate us – that we are the lords of the Earth because <u>you</u> love me & I love <u>you</u> . May 1911 bring you all the joys that I can wish you &darrlingI am lying <u>breathless</u> in your dear arms. Belle</p>
