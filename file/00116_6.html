<p>him very very much. He has been so adorable to me this year, kinder & more tender & more sympathetic than ever before and I feel so <u>near</u> to him – not at all, as you know, in the same way as the other women he knows. By the way, do you not think it would be a good idea to keep the Cesena book until he gets to London & then you can take it and give it to him yourself and dear,</p>
<p>be as tactful as you can about his art things & <u>don’t</u> tell him all his things are punk – if you <u>must</u> be so damned honest in your opinion, at least be non-committal & remember that he <u>never</u> tires of flattery – he can swallow the most barefaced kind & <u>loves</u>  <u>it</u> and don’t be afraid to let him <u>see</u> that you admire & like him <u>very</u>  <u>much</u> personally – It will all be for our good</p>
