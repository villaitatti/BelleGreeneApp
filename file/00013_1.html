<p>Wednesday – April 14 –</p>
<p>Well – my dear – I little expected to be here today but I got back to New York on Sunday to find that I was booked to leave for Hot Springs at four in the afternoon! Can you imagine the bustle of unpacking and repacking (thank Heavens for a maid worth her weight in diamonds!)</p>
<p>lunching (at the Colony Club, by the way, where I saw several of your devotees!) hearing a bit of Kitty Chatham & dashing for the train. Mrs French brought a small party of us down here to open her house for her. Alas we found the house not ready to be opened & had to come over to this hotel where we stay until tomorrow</p>
<p>The earth has been flooded several times</p>
