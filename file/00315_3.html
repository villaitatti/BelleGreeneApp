<p>everything you have. I think that, for the first time, I know what it is to be madly furiously envious. The seated Buddha with two attendants (from Bing) is simply adorable; with those stunning guardian beasties below and that delightful lotus design above – I find it so marvellous a composition and in such perfect condition I shall "passeparlant" that at once and have it always on my desk. The bronze vessel of course is great too</p>

<p>but it does not pierce me to the heart as the stone does. [ <i>quadruple underlined</i> : but] the most wonderful thing I almost ever saw, is your standing Buddha (?) from Rosenberg. B.B. darlingest I'd gladly commit murder to have that. Rosenberg sent me a stunning, side-view photograph – Such Serenity, Such complete inner repose I never saw and the drapery and lines are simply marvellous – It is standing on my desk now and will always stay there.</p>
<p>The beast – it must be some</p>
