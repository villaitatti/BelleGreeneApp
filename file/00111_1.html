<p>Friday <u>Dec. 30</u> </p>
<p>This is my [ <i>triple underlined</i> : fourth] letter to you this week – insatiable man! I just enclose this [sic] few lines from Marie which I thought would amuse you – I have just written her today to come back to me at once & life will be worth living again –</p>
<p>I am <u>not</u> going to divulge to you <u>any</u> of my sentiments (high & lofty as they are) for you – Don’t forget four (4) in <u>one</u> week – Belle</p>
