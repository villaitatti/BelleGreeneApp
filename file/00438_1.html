<p>Dear B.B.,</p>
<p>Because of a discussion, in which your name has been pretty freely used, I want to ask your free and frank opinion (for <u>myself</u> â€“ not for publication) of Offner's article on our Macrino d'Alba, in the last number of Art in America. To me it is the most <u>filthy</u> exhibition of meaningless word-mouthing that I have come across for a long time.</p>
<p>I <u>could</u> say much more, but will refrain. I am told you regard his work highly, and shall not rest peacefully until I know if this is true, and, if so, why am I so fearfully wrong?</p>
<p>I think Gertrude Stein's portrait of Mabel Dodge is a master-piece compared with this "drool".</p>
<p>Always Yours,</p>
