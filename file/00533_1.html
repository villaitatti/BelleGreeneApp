<p>B.B. you old Darlint</p>
<p>Your letter from Girgenti (is that a place or a <u>Disease</u>?) amused me hugely – I snorted with rage and chortled with glee – Instead of the likes of you being glad that I keep the corps(e) of me pure and chaste, here you are reviling me for not allowing it to be a masculine urinal!</p>
<p>Sure I’m pure in heart body & mind – which reminds me, I only realized about a year ago, why your damned old sex gets all </p>

<p>het-up. & I’m sure its because <u>I</u> throw it all off, sorter sweat it out – in seeing things I like – in interest in the job & all sorts of things & people connected with it – and in a kind of <u>real</u> love and affection for the few people I love (you being pretty near the top) and <u>that</u> kind is too deep to be ‘sexey’ – for after all, that’s a crust very near the surface isn’t it now really?</p>
<p>So that’s <u>that</u>. </p>
<p>I’ve never been to Sicily. I’m <u>acheing</u> [sic] to go there. Perhaps I can do it next year. Is Mrs. Royall Tyler</p>
