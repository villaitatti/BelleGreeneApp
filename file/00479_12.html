<p>the monthly scourge of a just God. I had my mail brought over from the Library, but so far have read only yours and a queer steamer note from Mary.</p>
<p>I how lately reread your Franciscan legend – I find it the most fascinating of all your writings known to me – It is as lovable and “busily well doing” as Francis himself, and is the one book that I want you to autograph for me – I think you said that you did not have an extra copy so I shall send mine over to you and don’t you <u>dare</u> to forget to return it! – I seem to remember that you promised to give me the manuscript – did you? </p>
<p>Chained to my bed – by the sins</p>
