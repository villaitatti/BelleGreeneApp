<p>Ethel said she wrote you a line to see you I really was veryfitso you probably know what my address in Paris will be but in any case I will add it here</p>
<p>66 rue Mozart</p>
<p>care Mrs. Hyde –</p>
<p>They tell me it is quite far from the centre of things which is a bit of a pity but Ethel has been so kind to me that I really cannot refuse to go – She is a great brick</p>
<p>I must stop now as I have a dinner engagement at 8 – I think I would <u>rather</u> you did not meet me at the Station as I shall probably be tired and it will be so late & we couldn’t have much of a talk – <u>so</u> if I <u>do</u> get off on Wednesday will you come for me some time Thursday afternoon as I have a business engagement in the morning – Write and let me</p>
