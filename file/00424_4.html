<p>which to me is the <u>first</u> and <u>last</u> word in Chinese bronze – If I had it Ishouldfeel that I neverneed own another. See if Vignier hasn’t the photographs to show you – His jades (early) are to me very inferior & I don’t see why he bothers to collect them at all – His Ming & Kang hsi porcelains are way below average & the house is simply <u>hideous</u> . I met these two people I liked very much,Lord & Lady French (Irish)He had been in China seven years & knew every one I wanted information about, among themBackhouse, who is new in America – He is a <u>most</u> delightful man & both of them are <u>real Irish</u> & are for home rule much to the dismay of all the other people who were there. But it is a subject which has greatly interested me, ever</p>
