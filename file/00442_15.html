<p>to Rome – I have written to the Palace, Excelsior & Grand Hotels (as I hear there is not a room to be had in Rome) and will take whichever I hear from first – I must be in London for the Yates Thomspon sale of manuscripts They have not settled the date of that yet but I will hear in a few days – I expect it to be early in April – I am personally much inclined to go by the Fabre line by way of Gibraltar & Naples as I have never been in either spot, but J.P. is opposed to it as he says they are such rotten boats etc. In any case I will write you as soon as I have any definite plans – I hope to stay in Paris about a <u>month</u> –</p>
<p>I am as proud as punch over having J.P. an LLD. of Cambridge – I really do not know any honor I would rather have had for him – except [ <i>underlined twice</i> : perhaps] Oxford –</p>
<p>Write me all you can that <u>will</u>  <u>reach</u>  <u>here</u> before Fev. 15</p>
<p>Devotedly Yours,</p>
<p>Belle</p>
