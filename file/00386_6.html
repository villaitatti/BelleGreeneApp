<p>want to do it all up in grand style when I tell you I’m trying to do the impossible – by getting Duveen’s galleries. As you know they have <u>never</u> allowed an exhibition of <u>any</u> kind except their own but Uncle Henry says “god bless you my dear – if <u>anyone</u> can have it you can and there are 999 chances out of a thousand that <u>you</u> [ <i>triple underlined:</i> can] have it” – so do be an</p>
<p>angel and when the time comes, help me along – I am going to try to get things from Freer, Mrs. Havemeyer, Mrs, Lebmann, Mr. Mansfield Mr. Peters, the Boston Museum, Wetzel, Denman Ross, [ <i>triple underlined:</i> even] Wusabella (Duveen says he’ll do that) and have something approaching (but of course still keeping a respectful distance!!) the Munich exhibition – now tell me what you think of my scheme.</p>
