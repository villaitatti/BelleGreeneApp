<p>course I will write you all about the lecture – I forgot to tell you that Sirén asked me if I was a “Berensonian” I said “dyed in the wool” and he laughed.

<p>Did you, by the way, buy her new Daddi? and did you expect she would buy the Domencio or do you think Denman ross brought her over? One of her young men, named Post, is coming here tomorrow and I am going to lunch</p>

<p>with him, so I shall probably hear all the latest news there – Now I am off to spend an hour at the Museum of Natural History as I feel just in the mood – Your friend Agoness has called up several times but I have not seen her nor do I intend to, although I’ll try to avoid any open breach, but I certainly am tired of that woman –</p>
<p>I am rushing this off by the Lusitania so goodbye darling – Do you think I love you now?</p>
<p>Ever Your <u>Belle</u> </p>
