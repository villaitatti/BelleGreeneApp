<p>Jack & I have been close friends for almost two years – at the beginning he <u>thought</u> he was desperately in love with me – I knew all the time he was not & so just passed it off & ignored it & whenever he tried to talk about it I laughed & joked at it & poked fun at him about it. For the last year we</p>
<p>have been <u>simply</u> awfully good comrades – I admire him & his work & he seems to return in like – Miss Marbury is <u>sure</u> he is <u>dying</u> of love for me & that I have revved his life & that I am a vicious “man-snatcher” (which of course is diametrically opposed to all of her <u>own</u> feelings) & so she told Mrs. Brunner – <u>You</u> could take care of yourself but “that poor Mr. Cosgrave”</p>
