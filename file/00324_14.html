<p>tell you that I have given two little boys here a letter of introduction to you (in Paris) – They are Barry Faulkner (a painterman) and Paul Manship a sculptorman – Perhaps you will remember seeing a rather nice “Mother & Child” by the latter at Mrs. Guinness’ – He is a very quiet and very sane chap who has (I think) a great deal of talent, if not</p>
<p>genius. They are both very anxious to meet you and they are both quite mad about Chinese Art – they spent several days at Freer’s and feel just the way we do about it all – they are anxious to be told where they can see Chinese things in Paris and I don’t want you to bother with them <u>one</u>  <u>minute</u> , but if you don’t mind my asking you, <u>could</u> you tell them where to go in Paris & how</p>
