<p>[p. 1]</p>
<p>Wednesday morning </p>
<p>Dearest B.B. – </p>
<p>You will forgive my breaking the “rule” of daily writing — yesterday. It was the anniversary of Mr. Morgan’s death and I went into the silence for the whole day and <u>could</u> not speak to anyone</p>
<p>[p. 2]</p>
<p>else. It was one of the hardest days I have ever spent and I am still numb and dumb from it – We closed the Library for the day and intensified the hurt of it all by receiving mourners – The great love that so many had for him, was shown by the beautiful flowers </p>
