											<p>Belle Greene ran the Morgan Library for forty-three years—initially as the private librarian of J. Pierpont Morgan and then his son, Jack, and later as the inaugural director of the Pierpont Morgan Library (now the Morgan Library &amp; Museum).</p>
											<p>She attracted considerable attention both in the press and from her many admirers, among them the Italian Renaissance art historian, scholar, and connoisseur Bernard Berenson (1865–1959).</p>

                            <p>Belle da Costa Greene first met Bernard and Mary Berenson in January 1909, when they visited J. Pierpont Morgan’s Library in New York. Belle and Bernard began to correspond a month later, in late February 1909, and this is their first letter. With a formality befitting this initial, brief message, Greene addressed the letter to “Dear Mr. Berenson” and signed her full name at the end. (Later letters were typically sent to “B.B.” by “Belle”.) Belle expresses her dissatisfaction that Bernard could not join her for lunch, but is thrilled that he will “be a real friend.”</p>

                            <p>This letter captures Greene happy, in love, and on vacation. She escaped the city (and library) for Tuxedo, NY around Easter Sunday 1909. After mentioning the typical country activities of horseback riding, dancing, and motor picnicking, she describes in quasi-spiritual language her experience outdoors, “all alone with the sunlight and a little stream of sparkling water that runs through the grounds.” These meditations on nature culminate in Belle imagining Bernard, her “soul-companion,” the mere thought of whom causes “all sense of space and separateness [to be] lost.” Her writing and thinking about nature in this letter exhibits a literary sensibility of style that recurs throughout much of her personal correspondence.</p>

                            <p>Bernard Berenson and Pierpont Morgan did not get along very well. Morgan slighting him for the Metropolitan Museum of Art Directorship is only the most famous example of their mutual dislike for one another. We know from Greene’s letters that Morgan had his suspicions about her and Berenson, and certainly Berenson did not always think highly of Morgan’s taste in art. Greene, however, was quite devoted to Morgan and in this letter vehemently defends him against Berenson’s criticisms. As she writes, “There is an honesty of thought between us – a soul-oneness which makes it possible for him to tell me things which, as he has often said, he has told no other living being.” Together with correspondence that contains more unflattering portrayals of Morgan, this letter helps articulate the complex character of Greene’s relationship with her boss.  </p>

                          <p>In October 1910 Greene makes a telling comment about her letters, suggesting that Berenson wanted her to include a diary-like level of detail in her correspondence to him: “You see dear, how I am living up to your desire of a diary but for God’s Sake let me know it bores you.” It has been erroneously said that Greene referred to her letters as “her diary,” when in fact she mentions an actual diary, running to at least ten volumes, that she began using in the fall of 1909. In this letter, Greene describes her diary to Berenson and asserts that she “shall never allow a living soul to see it + for that reason I write things I hardly dare think.” Elsewhere she says her diary functions “as though it were another Belle.” The diaries, unlike these letters, do not survive today, and were presumably destroyed by Greene before her death. </p>

                          <p>Three years before the epochal Armory Show exhibition of modern art, Belle da Costa Greene was viewing Henri Matisse drawings in Manhattan. This letter recounts, in part, Greene’s visit to the Photo Secession, or 291 Gallery, “where [her] two dearly beloved’s Stieglitz + Steichen hold forth.” Here, in March 1910, she saw an early exhibition of Henri Matisse drawings (she would buy one in 1912). She regarded the Matisse exhibition with conflicting emotions: “They are the most extraordinary things I have ever seen. it was absolutely new to me and almost incomprehensible. I don’t understand what he is trying to do, what he is wanting to make me think whether an emphasis of character (sometimes called caricature) although at first it appeared to me to be only a series of extravagant contortions. They shocked + repelled me strongly at first but held me there quite two hours.” Greene would own works of modern art by creators such as Abraham Walkowitz and Clara Tice, contribute a short piece to the journal Camera Work, and have interesting encounters with Marcel Duchamp and Francis Picabia, though she did not herself contribute to the cultural movement of American modernism. </p>

                            <p>From August through September 1910 Belle Greene traveled to Europe and for the first time toured part of Italy with Bernard Berenson. They viewed art, visited small towns, and enjoyed an intimacy rare for their long-distance relationship. There is some evidence that Belle Greene may have become pregnant in Italy, and subsequently taken an abortifacient under a doctor’s supervision in London, though the evidence is inconclusive. After returning to New York from London, Belle Greene sent this telegram to Berenson: “Home well miss you terribly write often,” with “Belle” written underneath in Bernard’s hand.</p>

                                <p>This chatty letter covers a range of topics, from grapefruit shipments and Fortuny gowns to opera and Pierpont Morgan’s jealousies. In response to photographs of works from Bernard’s art collection Belle writes, “It is a wonderful collection I think but I love the last one you got – the Bonfigli Nativity best – It is so delightful a composition + the Virgin is so non earthly + mystic + wondering + adoring I love her tiny narrow shoulders + her lovely lovely robe – The colours must be too heavenly.” Enthusiastic exchanges about specific works of art are a hallmark of the Greene–Berenson correspondence, which reflects as much the intellectual as the romantic connections between Belle and Bernard. At the end of the letter Greene announces a big raise in her salary to $10,000/year (she started at the Morgan in 1905 making $900/year); the purchasing power of that salary in 1911 is worth around $300,000 in 2022 dollars. </p>

                              <p>In July 1912 Belle Greene moved into her eighth residence since she first came to New York City in 1887. She describes her four-room apartment at 104 East 40th Street in this letter to Berenson, supplementing her words with an annotated floor plan sketch. The “library and living room” is the largest space in Belle’s home, which neighbors her mother’s apartment next door and also contains a room for Marie, her live-in maid. It is likely this apartment that Paul Thompson photographed around 1915 for an image of Greene that would appear widely in newspapers. Annotated fragments of Thompson’s photos of Greene survive at I Tatti, presumably sent as an enclosure in one of her letters to Berenson. The fragments all illustrate East Asian sculpture from Greene’s private art collection, and one of the annotations indicates the photos were taken “at home.”</p>

                              <p>Other than a telegram reading “my heart and life are broken,” this letter is the first Greene sent Berenson after Pierpont Morgan’s death on March 31, 1913. It is written on mourning stationery and opens with a touching description of Morgan’s body returning to the Library: “He came back to me and the Library he loved so much, last night at six o’clock. We fixed his room for him almost exactly as it was on Christmas Day – all red and white roses and a few wreaths. I cannot tell you how beautiful it looks – It has resulted in just what we aimed at – a homecoming.” In this short letter Greene understandably feels confused and uncertain about the future—feeling “as one enveloped in a dense fog.” Yet Morgan’s memory remains strong for Greene: “To have been so sure of his love and trust that I have never questioned it, gives me an inspiration for all the rest of my life – I shall be working for him, every hour of every day to come.”</p>

                                <p>This letter is one of their last pieces of correspondence and was written during the waning days of the Second World War. The war had taken a personal toll on Belle Greene, whose nephew Bobbie, while stationed in England, took his own life in 1943. Greene thanks Berenson for remembering Bobbie and acknowledges the difficulties of the past few years, with Jack Morgan, Bobbie, and her mother all dying in 1943. Despite the hardships of the 1940s, Berenson’s letter takes Greene back to happier times: “I cannot tell you what it meant to me – just like the dear gone days to hear from you again. In these terrible days I (occasionally!) remind myself that after all we knew a grand time and lived a grand life.” Greene would retire three years later and would die in 1950.</p>
