                                        <p>The transcriptions of Belle Greene’s letters to Bernard Berenson are semi-diplomatic, meaning that minor editorial changes have been made to the text to facilitate legibility. For the most part, her punctuation has been retained. The piece of punctuation she used most frequently is the dash. These dashes vary in length and thickness, and rather than attempting to imitate these dash variations we have opted to use an en dash throughout. We have chosen to set off these en dashes by spaces, since Belle Greene always included space around her dashes. In some cases she relied on line breaks (and the edges of letter sheets) to indicate hard stops. We have not retained line breaks in our transcriptions, and in cases where legibility has been consequently compromised we have added “[.]” to indicate a hard stop. </p>
                                        <p>Deletions are indicated by strikethroughs, while interlinear additions are indicated by carets and brackets (e.g., “[^tonight^]”). Illegible deletions are indicated by “[illegible deletion],” illegible words by “[illegible]” or “[?],” and paper losses by “[loss].” All of Belle Greene’s frequent underlining has been retained, with her double, triple, quadruple, etc. underlinings indicated by bracketed notes (e.g., “[double underlined: your] benefit”). Occasionally other editorial notes are indicated in brackets, such as changes in ink color, shifts in paper orientation, notes in the margins, and the like. For hyphenated words at page breaks, hyphens have been removed and the word has been transcribed fully on the page containing the larger proportion of letters in its hyphenated fragment. Greene rarely paginated or foliated her letters; when she included this information it has been transcribed. But for ease of reference, all letter pages on the website contain bracketed page numbers, indicated by “[p. 1],” “[p. 2],” etc. </p>
                                        <p>“[sic]” has been used throughout for misspelled words and typos, but we have elected not to use it in several cases: when Greene intentionally used phonetic spelling (e.g., “wimin” for “women” or “larnin’” for “learning”; when Greene used exaggerated spellings such as “daaaarling”; when Greene used British spellings such as “travelled,” “colour,” and the like; and for some proper names.</p>
                                        <p>Nearly every sheet of Greene’s letters to Berenson were foliated or paginated in pencil by a later hand, most likely belonging to Nicky Mariano. In some cases the sheets are out of order despite these numbers running in sequence, and every effort has been made to restore the original order intended by Belle Greene. Some letters are incomplete or fragmentary.</p>
                                        <p>Every letter in the corpus was transcribed, edited by a second transcriber, and then finalized by the project leads. Every effort was made to transcribe Greene’s words with the utmost accuracy, but there are a few illegible words remaining. If you have a correction to make to our transcriptions or metadata, please email <a href="mailto:greeneberensonletters@themorgan.org">greeneberensonletters@themorgan.org</a>. </p>
                                        <h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-1195dcc4 gb-headline-text">Metadata</h3>
                                        <p>The project team worked hard to extract useful metadata from Greene’s letters to Berenson. Personal names of Belle Greene’s contemporaries (numbering over 1200), subjects, and letter contents have been provided for each letter, as have the following pieces of information: letter date, archival box/folder number, sender/recipient names, letterhead transcription, number of pages, and transcriber names. “People mentioned” names are sourced from a controlled list and hyperlinked to a list of every letter containing that name in the corpus. “Subjects” are also sourced from a controlled, bespoke list. “Letter contents” comprise brief descriptions and summaries of the contents of a given letter. For each of these metadata fields, individual values are separated by semicolons. “Accompanying material” indicates the current or former presence of enclosures. The abbreviations BG (Belle Greene), BB (Bernard Berenson), and JPM (J. Pierpont Morgan) are used throughout the “letter contents” field.</p>
                                        <p>“Notes” is used in a few ways: to record additional information about the letter not included in other fields; to indicate mis-dating and provide rationales for assigning a new date; to indicate if a letter is a telegram, cablegram, or postcard; and to indicate the presence of dating notes by Bernard Berenson. Berenson frequently dated Greene’s letters on the first page, but his notes are not recorded in the transcriptions themselves, which are meant to capture only Greene’s words. Berenson’s notes about dating can be found in the “Notes” field. </p>
                                        <h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-1195dcc4 gb-headline-text">Racist Language</h3>
                                        <p>The letters compiled on this website occasionally contain racist stereotyping and slurs. The fact that Greene made derogatory comments about skin color cannot be so easily viewed as a negative statement on her perspectives. Passing is a complicated and nuanced practice and passing individuals found ways to maneuver in a world that perceived them as inferior because of their skin complexion. Belle Greene’s use of anti-Black racist words in some of her letters—including “darky” and the “n” word—could have been a way for her to avoid suspicion about her ancestry, as public figures who expressed sympathy for the African American community were often met with rumors that they must be hiding Black ancestry. Such rumors about Babe Ruth, for example, arose when he advocated for the African American community in the 1930s. Belle Greene’s racist language is difficult to comprehend and accept, but it does not simply mean she had appropriated the white supremacist ideology current in her day. This language could have been used as a strategy, as a racial performance of passing in Jim Crow America, though that does not dismiss the negative impact the language has had on readers in both Greene’s day and our own.</p>
